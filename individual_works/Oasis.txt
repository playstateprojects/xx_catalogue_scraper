ISMN: 979-0-50182-261-4 h.m. Instrumentation: Children choir including 6 soloists and chamber orchestra: flute (picc), oboe, 2 clarinets, guitar, 4 violins, violoncel- lo, double-bass, percussion: tamb.gr/Djam- be, susp. cymbal, oriental drum, sleigh-bells "This children's opera [....] is an amazing piece of art. Its catchy melodies were sung beautifully by the children, who clearly en- joyed performing the opera. [...] Children and older viewers alike will find in it some- thing that can affect their artistic sensibili- ties, or even affect the timeless idea of life. I hope that there will be more shows like the one in Rusovciach, and that the beautiful oriental and Old Testament themes will be revealed to more opera viewers."
