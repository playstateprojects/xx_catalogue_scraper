Annotations: This piece is divided in two parts, the Improvisation and Final. The first part starts with piano solo, followed by a small candeza for the bass (Lent). This part happens in the middle and upper registers of the instrument and has a strong chromatic material, forwardly oriented in sixteens. The Final is a â€œPresto" in duple meter that has as its main characteristics the quick changes from arco to pizzicato and the use of short notes. It ends with a driven passage of triplets starting on lower and reaching higher notes. Very accented and decisive Piu Vivo ending.
