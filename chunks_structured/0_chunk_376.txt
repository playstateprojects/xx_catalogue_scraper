McCormick, Gaelen
The Double Bass Duet Project (20 duos)
Instrumentation: db (2)
Number of Performers: 2
Annotations: "These duets help to form great posture habits for the left hand, using simpler bass 2 parts to help players hear intonation accuracy. They are just plain fun! All named after snack foods, because who doesn't love a good sweet or salty snack?" - Notes from the Duet Project website: http://www.bassretreat.com/product/duet- project-book/
