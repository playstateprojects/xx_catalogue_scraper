The title of this music is an over-literal translation of the title of Francois Couperin's harpsichord tutor of 1716, L'art de toucher le clavecin. It seemed appropriate for a piece which begins with the player pressing single keys tentatively, as if encountering the instrument for the first time, and ends ten minutes later with the same repeated notes marked ‘confident and relaxed'. In the interim, the music, which is in a single continuous movement, demonstrates the many ways in which the piano keys can be touched, from the gentlest of strokes to the most vicious of blows. J.W.

UNLOCKED arises out of my interest in the magnificent collection of American folksongs in the Library of Congress, Washington, collected by John and Alan Lomax in the 1930s. A significant proportion of the songs were collected from prisoners – mostly black prisoners in Southern jails. The piece is made up of freely composed cello ‘fantasias' inspired by five of these songs: No.1 (Make Me A Garment) is based on a song sung by a prisoner in Florida who was found by the Lomaxes in the tuberculosis ward and could only whisper his song.
No.2 (No Justice) is a set of variations, using extended playing techniques, grownig out of a simple prison song from Georgia (original title ‘Oh we don't get no justice in Atlanta'). No 3 (The Wind Blow East) comes from fragments of a chorus heard in the Bahamas – it represents the prisoner's dream of a better life.
No.4 (The Keys To The Prison) is based on an original song sung by a 15-year old (Cajun) girl in French. In the song, a boy in prison sings to his mother, ‘Hey mom, I've got the keys to the prison and I'm going to escape'. She says 'How come, when the warders have the keys hanging round their necks?' and so it goes on. The music composed around it is very fast and agile, and for me represents the prisoner's fantasy that the prison doors are suddenly wide open, and the guards have all gone.
No.5 (Trouble, Trouble) is a transcription/arrangement of a blues sung by a prisoner in Alabama. J.W.
