Annotations: "This song cycle is my response to eight surrealist works by René Magritte, whose famous The Treachery of Images highlights the impossibility of art to truly reflect reality (...) I have tried to capture the same spirit of mystery in both the words and the music." - Notes from the composer's official website (http://www.rebekahdriscoll.com/music/la-traicion-de-las-imagenes/) Source: CW; NYWC
