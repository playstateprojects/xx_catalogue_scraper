Instrumentation: db
Duration: 5'
Number of Performers: 1
Annotations: Use of triplets, quintuplets and syncopation. Groovy and jazzy atmosphere, reinforced by the use of percussive "short noise" notes (stopping strings with hands). The piece displays higher registers of the bass in pizzicato which are sometimes ornamented by slides. "Laid Back". The piece slowly brings musical ideas to lower registers of the bass until it finally introduces the bow, still accompanied by left hand noise. Overall short thematic material, emphasis on rhythm.
Playing Techniques: pizz; snap pizz; indeterminate note; gliss; s.p.; art. harmonics; nat. harmonics; sfz; roll finger; vary bow pressure.

Date of Composition: 1993 Instrumentation: db
Number of Performers: 1
Annotations: Based on "The Orchestra", a poem by William Carlos Williams. The piece can be considered a transcription of the poem for double bass in which certain pitches are assigned to vowels and bass techniques are assigned to consonantes. This approach emphasises the poem as sound. Score + poem + table of consonants and vowels.
Playing Techniques: c.l.b; s.p.; pizz with damper note; sfz; c.l.b on the bridge; knock wood; tr.; vibrato; gliss; damp string, spiccato; partial pressure (get some fundamentals + overtones); trem.; strong pressure; hit strings with finger.
