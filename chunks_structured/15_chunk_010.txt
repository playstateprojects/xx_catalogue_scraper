Saariaho's music follows in the French spectralist tradition and is continually ‘varied and wondrously strange'. Her ‘pieces unfold with minute and seemingly constant shifts of subtle sounds and colourings... melodic lines escape from sustained, quivering sonorities and spin off, sometimes disappearing into an ether' (The New York Times). She was the first female composer to be programmed at the Metropolitan Opera in over one hundred years, after Ethel Smyth.
