Number of Performers: 2
Annotations: Original composition by Chiquinha Gonzaga. Two contrasting movements, one very catabile and expressivo and the other, an energitic dance-like maxixe. I - Lua Branca - da opereta "O Forrobodo" (White Moon - from the opereta "O Forrobodo" II - O "Corta-Jaca". The premiere of "Corta-Jaca" happened in 1914 at the presidential palace with the collaboration of the first lady on the guitar. This episode was considered a scandal at the time. The critics disapproved the lifestyle at the palace and the dissemination of music whose origins were from "vulgar" dances, contrary to the values of the aristocratic social elite.
