Libretto (English) by the composer
Soprano solo
No survey of Judith Weir's operas would be truly complete without this masterfully compressed miniature epic telling the story of the lesser-known invasion of England in 1066. The solo soprano takes on eight different roles – not to mention the part of the Norwegian army depicting the invasion, led by Norwegian King Harald 'Hardradi', which ended in defeat at the battle of Stamford Bridge, 19 days before the successful Norman invasion at the Battle of Hastings. The story is told in three acts and at breakneck speed, with much of the detail taken from a 13th century account of the invasion found in the Icelandic saga Heimskringla.
“King Harald's Saga... embodies the qualities that still define Weir's musical thinking: her concern to tell stories, her ability to distil musical and dramatic ideas to their essences, and her creation of an idiom that's full of expressive subtlety but is never anything less than richly communicative.”
