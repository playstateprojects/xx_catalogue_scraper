Music for Double Bass and Piano
Date of Composition: 1971
Instrumentation: db; pf
Duration: 7'
Publisher: Yorke Edition Y.E. 0017
Number of Performers: 2
123
Annotations: This piece has a recurrent use of double stops glissando. Maconchy explores contrasts by juxtaposing an agitated Allegro that emphasizes aleatory beats, and a Lento with a calm use of harmonics. There is a moment “senza misura” that almost sounds like a Candeza for the double bass. Interesting and eventful piece.
