Annotations: "This work draws heavily on Ukrainian weeping tradition, half-sung, half-chanted performances which mourn the dead. Each instrument imitates particular singers. The bass part includes explorations of high
natural harmonics in a melodic fashion, as well as low weeping passages." - Notes from the composer Online suggested recordings: https://soundcloud.com/annapidgorna/weeping-excerpt Source: C; CW
