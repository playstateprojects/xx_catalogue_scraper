Good Morning, Midnight is a five-movement song cycle for voice and 10-part ensemble. Although first sung by a mezzo soprano (Sarah Connolly, with Aurora Orchestra conducted by Nicholas Collon) it is also suitable for baritone voice.
All five poems (by Kathleen Jamie, Charles Simic and Giacomo Leopardi, bookended by two Emily Dickinson lyrics) describe the strange, affecting, sometimes beautiful experience of being awake and observant during the night. The instrumentation (string octet plus clarinet and bass clarinet) accentuates the dark but occasionally radiant impressions the poets report.
The poems are:
1. Good Morning, Midnight (Emily Dickinson)
2. Moon (Kathleen Jamie)
3. The Clocks of the Dead (Charles Simic)
4. Alla luna (Giacomo Leopardi)
5. Lightly stepped a yellow star (Emily Dickinson)
The duration of Good Morning, Midnight is around 20 minutes. The work was commissioned by Wigmore Hall with the support of André Hoffmann, and first performed in 2015. J.W.
"This new piece, a setting of five poems on the subject of night and moon-light, had the beautiful lightness of touch and shy expressiveness that make her best pieces treasurable. For a piece ostensibly devoted to night, the music was astonishingly radiant... Night is portrayed as consoling and tender, a tone exactly caught in Weir's music. The radiance of Weir's piece seemed to permeate the entire evening.”

This major addition to the repertoire sets specially written texts by Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison and Clarissa Ping Estés depicting a woman's life through youth, middle age and maturity.
