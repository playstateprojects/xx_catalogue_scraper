Moon Jazz: River on the Moon
Date of Composition: 1999 Instrumentation: fl; cl; vn; va; db
Duration: 5'
Number of Performers: 5
Annotations: "Moon Jazz: River on the Moon is a post-minimalist romp in which fragments of jazzy materials are juxtaposed, layered, and interposed. With both rhythmic groove and metric displacement, each player contributes equally to a playful texture." - Notes from the composer's official website (http://lorettanotareschi.com/chambersolo- music/moon-jazz-river-on-the-moon)
