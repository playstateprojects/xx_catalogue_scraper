Annotations: "All players need to be able to feel a rhythm moving in 3+3+2. The tune is mostly shared between Basses 1 and 2 and while Bass 2 stays in 1st position, Bass 1 uses a mixture of positions from 1st to 3rd and Bass 3 uses 3rd position. All parts are equally challenging rhythmically." - Notes from the publisher's website (https://www.prestomusic.com/sheet-music/products/7490343--cathy-elliott-rumba) Technique Level: Beginner; intermediate
