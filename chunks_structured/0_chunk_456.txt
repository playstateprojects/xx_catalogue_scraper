Annotations: "This song is an hommage to a important Brazilian River, which in Sergipe (composer's State of residence), offers us wonderful landscapes around the longo do Cânion do Xingó, in the city of Candindé do São Francisco. In this composition, I seek to play with the ondulation of the water (represented by the harp glissandos), the strenth of the water and also its fluidity. The music is modal, in Brazilian Northeastern scale." - Translation from composer's notes.
