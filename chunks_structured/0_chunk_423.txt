Annotations: Fast, obsessive, chromatic and "furioso" material is carried along the piece. It has a hectic and forward aspect to it, with only a few moments of breath. "Transparent ambiguity. Contrasts between the low and the high, the short and the long, the fast and the slow." - Notes from the score
