Has there been a performance of your work which has particularly struck you or taken on a new life that you didn't expect?
Well, there hasn't been a performance yet... but the piece I am writing on commission just now – a song for solo baritone and piano based on the famous soliloquy of Calderón, has literally transformed itself into a dramatic monologue similar to a full opera scene. It has gripped me increasingly, revealing more of its breadth and its depth and significance as I daily try to live up to its challenges and do it justice musically.
