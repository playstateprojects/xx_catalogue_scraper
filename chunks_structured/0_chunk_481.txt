Annotations: Trailblaze is to be played full of energy and as fast as possible. The piece brings an extra flavor by including a vocal part, supposed to be sung at pitch (falseto) and with no vibrato, while still playing the bass part. It is very rich in extended techniques, rhythmic figures and metric changes. It also features a walking bass line. Playing Techniques: Jete; chords; gliss; art. harmonics; slap pizz; hammer-on; c.l.b.; L.H. pizz
