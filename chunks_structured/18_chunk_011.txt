SYNOPSIS
The story is freely based on the life of Harriet Tubman, a slave who escaped from bondage on the eastern shore of Maryland, and who became a â€˜conductor' on the Underground Railroad, returning back nineteen times and rescuing over three hundred of her people. At one time a reward of $40,000 was offered for her recapture alive or dead. The opera opens with slaves passionately crying out for freedom. They stand aside to reveal Harriet restlessly asleep in the house of Mr. Thomas Garrett, a Quaker - she has managed to escape North and so reach safety. But in her dream she is told that she must not pursue her life with Josiah, who has also made his way North, but like Moses, make the difficult journey to deliver her people from bondage. She is successful but she sacrifices her personal happiness. Maunela Hoelterhoff, writing in The Wall Street Journal said, 'Musgrave wrote her own libretto and she is as precise with words as she is with notes: her fictional additions meld seamlessly with Harriet's biography; her own mostly tonal music meshes smoothly with reworked spirituals'.
