This March was written at the instigation of Gennady Rozhdestvensky as an encore for the above mentioned concert in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, at which Edison Denisov's Peinture, Sofia Gubaidulina's Offertorium and Alfred Schnittke's Gogol Suite were performed. It was used by Schnittke as an introduction and finale of his ballet Sketches in 1985.
Sofia Gubaidulina has also written music for a number of films. She considers her most important works in this genre to be the scores for ‘The Scarecrow' (directed by Rolan Bykov, Mosfilm), ‘The University Chair' (Belorusfilm), ‘The Circus Tent', based on Federico García Lorca (directed by Ida Garanina, Ani- mated Film Studio Moscow), and ‘Veliki Samoyed' (directed by Arkadi Kor- don).
