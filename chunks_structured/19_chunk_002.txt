INTRODUCTION

-
Begin Afresh – it's not only the title of Judith Weir's piece for the 2023 Proms: that expression of enlivening renewal, a quote from Philip Larkin's poetry, is the signature quality of every note she writes.
No matter the drama or darkness of their subject matter, every piece of Judith Weir's glows with a luminous sense of freshness, of a new perspective gained and given to all of us listening. It's not only a feeling of novelty – although that's there too, in the joyous discovery of this uniquely generous catalogue of pieces across all genres, composed for amateurs as well as professionals, for soloists and youth and community choirs, for opera houses, coronations, and for festivals at the edges of our islands. It's also that Weir's music
has a power that's rapier-precise and radiantly all-encompassing. You're drawn into its enchantment, its quicksilver transformation of seeming simplicity into coruscating richness, its connecting of traditions of musicking and storytelling from all over the globe. There's a shimmering moment at the end of listening to any of her music in which the world seems changed. Your perception is renewed, everything around you refreshed, and the world vibrates with a chance to begin again.
