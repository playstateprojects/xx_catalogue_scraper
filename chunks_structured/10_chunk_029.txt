NON VIVENTE
Sikorski, Hamburg
A notated record of Vivente non vivente is not extant. The work was conceived for Evgeni Murzin's ANS synthesizer from 1957, whose sounds are pro- duced photo-electronically. Gubaidulina describes the compositional process: “ the composer applies black paint on a glass surface. The drawing is then exposed to light and this combination produces sound."
