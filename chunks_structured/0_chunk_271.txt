Pantomime
Date of Composition: 1966 Date of Publication: 1991 Instrumentation: db; pf Duration: 12'
Publisher: H. Sikorski
Number of Performers: 2
Annotations: Pantomime is characterized by strongly accented rhythms and the presence of a dark low register ostinato on the piano that haunts the listener through the piece. The double bass explores tritones and a diverse set of techniques such as glissando, col legno and ricochet, allowing the performer to create timbre variations in a deep dark environment. Always moving forward. Extremely well-written piece.
