Conclusion
LÃ©andre, Gubaidulina, and Dinescu are composers with distinct artistic views. Each one of them represents a composer who created diverse and significant contributions to the double bass repertoire and its performances. The three case studies reinforce the idea that each of the composers cited in this annotated catalog can be studied and investigated with the objective of enriching future performances settings with double bass works by women composers.
