THE BLACK SPIDER
Two stories with chilling parallels are told side-by-side in this opera for young performers, described by the composer as â€œsomewhere between a video nasty and an Ealing comedy" in tone. The scoring of the vocal and instrumental parts is flexible, making the opera practical for a wide range of settings and abilities.
The three acts of The Black Spider are framed by five spoken interludes. The interludes are set in the present day and are very closely based on news reports from Poland about recent excavations of a tomb in Krakow and the strange events that followed. The three (sung) acts of the opera are very loosely based on the Swiss-German novella Die Schwarze Spinne (1842) by Jeremias Gotthelf.
