A central theme of Bauckholt's work is the examination of the phenomena of perception and understanding. Her compositions often blur the boundaries between visual arts, musical theatre and concert music. She is especially fond of using noisy sounds, which are often produced by unconventional means such as extended instrumental techniques or bringing everyday objects into the concert hall.
