Cloudburst
Instrumentation: mar; timp; vib; db/vc
Number of Performers: 4
Annotations: The piece is inspired by a Texas summer rain storm. "Beginning softly, gently hinting at the
impending cloudburst, the piece builds in intensity, with the thunder and wind swelling, until the notes virtually explode with "rain". It then tapers off slowly, until the last droplets fall." - Notes from the composer's website (https://christinarusnak.com/cloudburst/)
