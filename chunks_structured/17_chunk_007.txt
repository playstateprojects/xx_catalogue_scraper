LOCH NESS A POSTCARD FROM SCOT LAND (2012)
Duration: 8 Minutes
Orchestration: 3(pic).3(ca).2+bcl.2+cbn/4331/timp.3perc/hp/str
This Scottish Loch Ness is famous for its monster - only very occasionally seen.
In this lighthearted work he, the monster (a tuba), emerges from the depths (E-flat) to find the sun (A major) coming out from a thick mist (string clusters, made up of an octatonic scale built from the triads of E-flat and A major and minor). As he plays he is warmed by the sparkling sun (trumpets) and by the strains of an ancient Scottish melody.
As the sun goes down, he dives back into the deep waters with a big splash. Then a cool moon rises, a light breeze ruffles the surface of the waters, and all is at peace.
