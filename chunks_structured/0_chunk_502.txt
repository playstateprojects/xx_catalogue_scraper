Date of Composition: 2014 Instrumentation: db (3) Duration: 10'
Number of Performers: 3
Annotations: “The Lost Oxen”. Graduation Exam. “The Lost Oxen proposes to explore the double bass almost as a topography. The performers are invited to approach their instrument with a sense of otherness and wander. The materiality of the instrument - the overwhelming dimension of its size – along with the gestures of the performers as they address extended techniques while pursuing specific sound results, becomes an interaction - ¿surprisingly? - delicate with the instrument. The three instruments work in cooperation to assembly a series of soundscapes that evolve from one state to another, always moving forward, weaving in time." - Notes from the composer Technique Level: Advanced
