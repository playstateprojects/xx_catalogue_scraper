What inspires you to write? Art, poetry, everyday life?
I need to focus on an idea to write music. That idea can come from poetry such as Songs for a Winter's Evening to poems of Robert Burns, or The Voices of our Ancestors to poems from the ancient world: or paintings such as the Turners in Turbulent Landscapes: the inherent variety of percussion instruments in my Journey through a Japanese Landscape for Evelyn Glennie: or simply a dramatic idea for programme music – such as Orfeo, Pierrot, Narcissus: or even an abstract idea which then works itself into a ‘dramatic-abstract' colloquy such as my Concerto for Orchestra, as well the concertos for clarinet, horn, viola, and oboe.
