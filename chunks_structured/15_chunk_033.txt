Outi Tarkiainen (b.1985) •
Edition Wilhelm Hansen | Finnish |
Intensely inspired by the myths and the nature of her native Lapland, Outi Tarkiainen writes music with roots as deep as the mosses and birch trees of the region. Having studied at the Sibelius Academy, the Guildhall School School of Music and Drama and the University of Miami, she has composed for everything from big bands to chamber groups and symphony orchestras, always writing music of depth and beauty.
