O Sweet Spontaneous Earth is a suite for chorus and string orchestra. The three movements set texts, by historical American poets, whose themes I have often referred to in earlier compositions. Each poem is about the Earth, and our experience of living on it.
O sweet spontaneous by E. E. Cummings (1894-1962) talks about the Earth's persevering efforts to regenerate itself despite the depredations of its inhabitants; the movement ends with an extended anthem on the word “spring”. Peace on Earth by William Carlos Williams (1883-1963) speaks of the magnificent constellations of stars shining in the sky above us while we sleep peacefully. The music borrows this contrast; energetic stars speeding through space, quietly immobile humanity beneath them. I reason, Earth is short by Emily Dickinson (1830-1886) ponders the short time we actually spend on Earth, and what happens afterwards. I borrowed the hymn-like feel of the poem to write a three-verse chorale, thoughtful in character, similar to the ending of a Bach cantata. J.W.
