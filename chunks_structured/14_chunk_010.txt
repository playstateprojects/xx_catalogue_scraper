THE VANISHING BRIDEGROOM
Commissioned to mark Glasgow's year as European Capital of Culture, The Vanishing Bridegroom presents three loosely-related Scottish folk tales taken from J F Campbell's collection Popular Tales of the West Highlands.
1. The Inheritance: A man dies, but his legacy is missing: one of his three sons must have stolen it, but which one? The Doctor investigates by telling the sons a tale of a woman, forbidden to marry her lover, and married off to a richer man.
II. The Disappearance: On the birth of the Bride and Bridegroom's daughter, the husband leaves to fetch the Priest who will christen her, but on the way is lured into a brightly lit hillside - the "Land of the Young". His friend is accused of murder.
III. The Stranger: A handsome prosperous stranger arrives to woo the daughter, now a young woman. The girl is suspicious, and a passing preacher tells her he is obviously the Devil: she retires to a holy spot and the Devil is unable to harm her.
