Instrumentation: db; orch./pf
Duration: 12'
Publisher: Canadian Music Centre Montreal
Number of Performers: 2+
Annotations: Intermezzo 1 starts with a catchy theme in moderate tempo, an interlude that says that some interesting story is about to happen. This theme is developed and reaches to an explosion later on. The second Intermezzo is more dissonant and intense. It includes a very idiomatic climax coming from a busy and chromatic double bass part, finally reaching a slower tempo and fuller sound. The bass is then well accompanied and enriched by the orchestra/piano part. Intermezzo 3 starts piano and mysterious, the double bass part resembles a lament. Cantabile and shifty. Premiere: Gary Karr, 1989. Printed from manuscript.
