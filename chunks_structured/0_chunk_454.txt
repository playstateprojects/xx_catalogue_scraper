Bossa Nova
Date of Composition: 2013 Instrumentation: d ens.
Number of Performers: 4+
Annotations: â€œIn Bossa Nova, the melody is shy/simple but not uninteresting. It starts being delineated by the first double bass, which constantly converses with the second bass. Basses 3 and 4 mantain the rhythm and sustain the harmony. Bossa Nova is, before anything, a song in which the lyrics should arise in the mind of the ones that are listening to it." - Translated from the composer's notes in the score. Source: SC; C
