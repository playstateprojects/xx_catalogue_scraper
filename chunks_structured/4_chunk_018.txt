A Composer Returns
“I cannot say that I feel entirely at home. That cannot be the case because the roots are somehow damaged.” In 2006 the composer Ursula Mamlok returned to her place of birth, Berlin. With her moving piano improvisations, the composer astonished audiences at the opening of a photo exhibition about the Holocaust memorial in Berlin.
