Satya III

Annotations: Satya III is probably the most well-known work for the double bass by Violeta Dinescu. The music is part of a set called "Satya" for different solo instruments composed by Dinescu in her earlier career in 1981. This piece has a very busy bass part and it frequently explores two voices, with pizz and arco playing at the same time in different regions of the bass. Although there is no time marking or measures, it has a sense of forwardness in the intensity and powerfulness of its gestures. The notation sometimes abandons the pentagram system, having only one or two lines, and the notes are loosely grouped together.
