SYNOPSIS
This, Musgrave's first opera, was composed very shortly after her return from Paris in 1955, where she had been studying with Nadia Boulanger for the previous four years. The story is taken from J. M. Wilson's Tales of the Scottish Border. A parallel with Puccini's Gianni Schicchi will be obvious to any opera lover. However, this is not surprising since both share a common source: Dante's Inferno, though in this opera the date is mid-sixteenth century and set in pre-Reformation Scotland.
With the cooperation of a witch-woman, Geills, the Abbot of Drimock feathers his nest by persuading the dying rich of the neighbourhood to alter their wills in his favour. In a particularly complex case, however, he declines to reward Geills. Bess, whose husband, the local laird Sir William, is grievously ill, has borne a child, Maggie, by the Abbot. Sir William dies, leaving his fortune to Maggie (whose plans to marry do not have her mother's approval) and to the Edinburgh lepers. Determined not to be outdone, Bess and the Abbot hush up the death and prepare to stage a reenactment which will prevent the marriage and save the fortune. The plans go awry and with Geills's help Maggie manages to turn everything to her advantage.
