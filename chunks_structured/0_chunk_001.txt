PUBLIC ABSTRACT
Issues surrounding diversity and inclusion have received increased attention in our contemporary society, influencing Western classical music education and concert programing by professional ensembles. Considering current literature on issues of diversity in the context of the Western classical musical canon and the particularly dominant gendered stereotypes surrounding composers and double bassists, this essay furthers the discussion of gender in the context of the double bass.
Given the general unfamiliarity of significant pieces for double bass by women composers, which are typically excluded from our books, schools and concert settings, this dissertation aims to address gender diversity by providing an annotated catalog of compositions by women for the double bass and three case studies of the composers Joëlle Léandre, Sofia Gubaidulina, and Violeta Dinescu.
This catalog includes solo and chamber pieces limited to five players, and it is supplemented with indexes that classify its contents by title, instrumentation, geographic region, and chronology. The goal of this dissertation is to make works for the double bass by women composers more accessible by providing reliable references to scores and recordings. Additionally, this compilation will encourage present compositions that can include and stimulate diverse performances for the double bass.
