Chuva no Sertão
Date of Composition: 2013 Instrumentation: db; pf Number of Performers: 2
Annotations: "In a figurative character, Chuva no Sertão illustrates the idea of the “sertanejo" waiting for the rain, which will irrigate the plantations, feed the cattle and end up their thirst, bringing happinees when the process of waiting finally ends. In this sense, the music beggins melancholic, hopeless. A theme in Brazilian Northeastern mode soon arrises, anouncing the new: the first drops of water (articulated between double bass anb piano). After that, everything is a party, or “baião”, a national symbol of the hapinness of the "sertanejo"." - Translated from the composer's notes in the score.
