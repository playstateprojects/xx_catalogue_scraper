Annotations: "The Suite "Tocando o Brasil" brings the idea of four of the most popular national rhytms from Brazil (baião, bossa nova, samba e frevo). The piece was written for the Orchestra Sergipiana de Contrabaixo, inspired by the OSCON and founded by Jair Maciel. In a pedagogical way, the piece also consists in a rhythm exercise to the group. In Baião de Doze there a simple theme, mostly in the first double bass, which sometimes dialogues with the second double bass. The main idea is to bring the atmosphere of the Brazilian Northeastern music, exploring dance, divertimento and simplicity, features so dear to me." - Translated from the composer's notes in the score.
