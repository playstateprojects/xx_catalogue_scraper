Annotations: The piece has four movements, the first, explores syncopation and different contact points for the bow. The second, faster and busier, includes some left hand alone techiniques, pizz and short notes. The third, changes the character to "childlike" with a slower tempo and tenuto sul ponticelo notes. Finally, the fourth, ends in a fast tempo with a strong use of double-stops and dissonances.
