Florence Price (1887-1953)
G Schirmer | American |
In 1933, Florence Price became the first African-American woman to have her work performed by a major American orchestra, when the Chicago Symphony Orchestra gave the world premiere of her Symphony No 1 in E Minor. Price's revelatory interpolation of different African American music styles into classical compositions will delight and empower audiences and creators for generations to come.
