Bertucci, Lea
Double Bass Crossfade
Instrumentation: Db (2); 10-channel sound Duration: 35'
Number of Performers: 2+
Annotations: Premiere: 2015 at Knockdown Center as part of AUDITORIUM by James Ilgenfritz and Sean Ali. The performance "positions two double bassists at opposite corners of the Knockdown Center's cacophonous main room. The instruments are wirelessly amplified, allowing the performers to slowly move across the room over the course of 40 minutes." - Notes from the composer's soundcloud page (https://soundcloud.com/lea-bertucci/double- bass-crossfade)
