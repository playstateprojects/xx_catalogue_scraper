Sparring with Shadows
Date of Composition: c. 2013 Instrumentation: db
Publisher: Recital Music
Number of Performers: 1
Annotations: Pemiered in 2013 at Wells Cathedral School by David Heyes."this piece is a duo for one player and his shadow. The relationship is a volatile one - at times there is sparring with angry repartee (as at the beginning)
and at others, there is dancing, a pale, ghostly waltz followed by a passionate, lyrical song where shadow and player become one in the dark. As the light returns so does the sparring!" - Notes from the publisher's website (http://www.recitalmusic.net/spweb/details.php?catno=RM755) Dedication: David Heyes and David Ellis
