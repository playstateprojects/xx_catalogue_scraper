You have ten operas to your name, would you say that's the form of music you are most comfortable writing? How important is ‘theatre' in your concert works?
I tend to think of music as drama - moving from one place to another and usually through some kind of conflict. That is why I feel opera is so natural for me. But I also have always seen and felt the inherent drama of instrumental music which, as you know, has created in my catalogue a whole genre of ‘dramatic-abstract' works without singers.
