Number of Performers: 4
Annotations: "This original Rag Time is for a mixed ability group of players. Bass 1 demands some simple thumb position work, Bass 2 is probably Grade 6, Bass 3 is about Grade 3, Bass 4 closer to Grade 4. All parts get to play the tune and all parts need to be good on syncopation and counting." - Notes from the publisher's website (https://www.prestomusic.com/sheet-music/products/7490342--cathy-elliott-tea-time-rag)
