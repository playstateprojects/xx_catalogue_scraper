Annotations: The piece explores the idea of balancing opposites. "Special attention is paid to the unique colorings of sound available on the double bass. This is signaled from the start, where high harmonics are used a sound not typically associated with the double bass by those whose knowledge of the instrument derives from the orchestral repertoire.
