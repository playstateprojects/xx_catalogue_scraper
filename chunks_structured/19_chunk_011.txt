Still, Glowing for an orchestra of strings, flutes, clarinets and keyboard percussion, is my one and (so far) only attempt at writing 'ambient music'. It is based on a chord sequence from my opera 'The Vanishing Bridegroom' and was written at the invitation of conductor André de Ridder for Sinfonia ViVA, an orchestra based in Nottingham, England.
