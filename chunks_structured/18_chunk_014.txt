SYNOPSIS
This opera was commissioned by New Orleans Opera to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase. This remarkable event, which doubled the size of the young United States of America, is the background of the story of the Pontalba family. Because of it, the family had to leave New Orleans for France.
The story of Micaela who married into this family is a dramatic one. After many years of financial struggle, Micaela's father-in-law in a desperate attempt to keep control of her dowry tries to kill her. He fails and, in his shame, kills himself. Micaela thus secures her inheritance and returns to New Orleans. As the first woman architect, she builds the famous Pontalba buildings in Jackson Square. She has managed to transcend the personal tragedies of her life, remain true to her calling, and to leave a lasting legacy of beauty and tranquillity for the city of her birth.
â€˜Musgrave composes for the stage with great skill. One can hear her sense of the orchestra and her ear for forward, ever-moving vocal lines as they listen to the events onstage and respond to them moment to moment. The crowd scenes and ensemble work are complex but free of tangles: every crossing musical line has its own clear story to tell.'
