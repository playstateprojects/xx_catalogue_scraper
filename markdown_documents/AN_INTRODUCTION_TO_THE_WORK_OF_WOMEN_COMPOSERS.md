## CELEBRATING WOMEN COMPOSERS

Wise Music Group has long celebrated diversity in its classical catalogues. We are regularly asked for information about music written by women composers, so we have prepared this interactive digital booklet to assist in programming and to provide inspiration.

The guide is laid out by composer in chronological order and focuses mainly on orchestral repertoire written across the centuries a rich offering of music by women at the top of their compositional game. You will find a brief introduction to each writer alongside repertoire suggestions and links to explore the music further online.

Visit wisemusicclassical.com for more details or contact your local Wise Music Group office or representative for further information about any of the composers or repertoire featured in this booklet.

In 1933, Florence Price became the first African-American woman to have her work performed by a major American orchestra, when the Chicago Symphony Orchestra gave the world premiere of her Symphony No 1 in E Minor. Price's revelatory interpolation of different African American music styles into classical compositions will delight and empower audiences and creators for generations to come.

## Kaija Saariaho (1952-2023) o

Chester Music | Finnish | 6

Saariaho's music follows in the French spectralist tradition and is continually ‘varied and wondrously strange'. Her ‘pieces unfold with minute and seemingly constant shifts of subtle sounds and colourings... melodic lines escape from sustained, quivering sonorities and spin off, sometimes disappearing into an ether' (The New York Times). She was the first female composer to be programmed at the Metropolitan Opera in over one hundred years, after Ethel Smyth.

Her compositions often blur the boundaries between visual arts, musical theatre and concert music. She is especially fond of using noisy sounds, which are often produced by unconventional means such as extended instrumental techniques or bringing everyday objects into the concert hall.
