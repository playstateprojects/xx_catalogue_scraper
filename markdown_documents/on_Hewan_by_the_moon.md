# INTRODUCTION

By Tom Service

-

Begin Afresh - it's not only the title of Judith Weir's piece for the 2023 Proms: that expression of enlivening renewal, a quote from Philip Larkin's poetry, is the signature quality of every note she writes.

No matter the drama or darkness of their subject matter, every piece of Judith Weir's glows with a luminous sense of freshness, of a new perspective gained and given to all of us listening. It's not only a feeling of novelty - although that's there too, in the joyous discovery of this uniquely generous catalogue of pieces across all genres, composed for amateurs as well as professionals, for soloists and youth and community choirs, for opera houses, coronations, and for festivals at the edges of our islands. It's also that Weir's music

has a power that's rapier-precise and radiantly all-encompassing. You're drawn into its enchantment, its quicksilver transformation of seeming simplicity into coruscating richness, its connecting of traditions of musicking and storytelling from all over the globe. There's a shimmering moment at the end of listening to any of her music in which the world seems changed. Your perception is renewed, everything around you refreshed, and the world vibrates with a chance to begin again.

# JUDITH WEIR THE COMPLETE CATALOGUE

Which is why listening to her music is so often an adventure that leaves you wanting more: you might start by hearing King Harald's Saga, her opera for solo singer (but a cast of thousands), which leads you to explore the spine-tingling play-within-a-play of her first full-scale stage work, A Night at the Chinese Opera. Or you begin with her choral music, like the blood-soaked drama of Missa del Cid, and wind up in the furthest reaches of the universe with her Moon and Star, setting Emily Dickinson for a cosmic choir and orchestra. On instead you listen to her song On Buying a Horse and realise there's another Horse poem in her orchestral song-cycle Natural History, which might lead you back to the battlefields of King Harald, where another journey through her music can begin again, and begin afresh.

And talking of beginnings: the openings of Judith Weir's are so often invitations to the otherworlds of her pieces, in which we're led by what sounds like simple gestures into a place in which the conventions of musical gravity and story-telling are upended.

Take the start of Moon and Star: three piccolos and three glockenspiels, moving down in steps, making a melody as beguilingly simple as you could imagine, and yet the harmonies underneath throw us up to the firmament and make you lose your

harmonic footing. When the choral voices enter, the magic only increases: the voices make gasps of wonder, phrases that are framed by the chiming of the glockenspiels and swelling brass writing from the depths of the orchestra. The miracle of this opening, written up there on the constellations and brought to earth by the magic of Weir's composition, is that none of its elements are in themselves complex. It's the way they're put together with such concision and precision that counts. They create a visceral sensation of vast spaces, but are made with an extraordinary economy. Moon and Star is a whole universe that lasts just 15 minutes, proving another of the definitive qualities of Judith Weir's music: the more concentrated and clear the idea is, the more of its imaginative power she can release.

There's a related alchemy at the start of Forest, for orchestra. Music for four solo violas and cello unfurls as if we're listening to part of a process that was already underway before our attention caught up with it, a cellular musical reaction that was always there, it just took Weir's imagination to find it. The way the ideas sprout “musical leaves”, as she writes, in how they enfold the whole orchestra, put her in mind of the “self-propagating" processes of nature, since “everything in the piece has grown from the tiny musical seeds encountered in the opening bars".

INTRODUCTION

Royal Philharmonic Society/Matt Crossick

This is organic music, but its teeming diversity and unpredictability, all stemming from the same musical seeds, isn't about proving this piece's compositional coherence, but an openness to incident and adventure. Forest is an orchestral work that's as surprising, as cosseting, and as disturbing as a walk in any natural landscape.

Those are openings that distil the essences of their pieces: there are other beginnings that plunge us into instantly conjured dramatic worlds, like the chiming harmonic radiance at the start of A Night at the Chinese Opera, which flings us out there with the Nightwatchman and the moonlit skies of 13th century China; or the Flying Prelude that opens Blond Eckbert. It's music is a simple scale with a twist, a tune that mimics the flapping of The Bird's wings. Composed in just two lines, it's music that's suspended above the earth, and which suspends all of us in the opera's upside-down world of dark fairytale.

But it's not only the conjured-afresh beginnings to her pieces. That feeling is a constant in Weir's music, as if it were always in state of becoming, of endlessly beginning. Forest ends with one of the most jaw-

dropping changes of scene in her orchestral music. She puts it like this: “Within the final pages, a different, more distinct world is occasionally glimpsed... On reaching the conclusion, a region of faint string chords,

I felt rather like a fairy tale character pressing deeper and deeper into a mysterious prospect of trees”.

The shimmering tremolo strings are spine- tingling revelations when you hear Forest as if you could touch the place behind reality, a region that's always there but hardly ever accessed, let alone given to us as an experience in musical time by a composer. Yet that's what Weir's music gives us. Those mysterious realms into which she is led by her music are where we follow as her listeners.

And if you take her invitation, and journey where the glint and glimmer of her imagination takes you, the world is remade: suddenly it's a place in which the mundane can become the magical, in which a grain of a story can stand for the whole universe, in which a bird sings, a glockenspiel chimes, and the cosmos responds. That's what Judith Weir's music gives us: an everyday transcendence, the extraordinary, magical reality.

BIOGRAPHY

Judith Weir was born into a Scottish family in 1954 but grew up near London. She was an oboe player, performing with the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain, and studied composition with John Tavener during her schooldays. She went on to Cambridge University, where her composition teacher was Robin Holloway; and in 1975 attended summer school at Tanglewood, where she worked with Gunther Schuller. After this she spent several years working in schools and adult education in rural southern England; followed by a period based in Scotland, teaching at Glasgow University and the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.

During this time, she began to write a series of operas (including King Harald's Saga, The Black Spider, A Night at the Chinese Opera, The Vanishing Bridegroom and Blond Eckbert) which have subsequently received many performances in the UK, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium and the USA.

The most recent opera is Miss Fortune, premiered at Bregenz in 2011, and then staged at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden in 2012. In collaboration with director Margaret Williams, Weir has created several opera films, including Scipio's Dream, Hello Dolly, and Armida.

As resident composer with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in the 1990s, she wrote several works for orchestra and chorus (including Forest, Storm and We are Shadows) which were premiered by the orchestra's then Music Director, Simon Rattle. She has been commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra (Music, Untangled and Natural History) the Minnesota Orchestra (The Welcome Arrival of Rain) and the London Sinfonietta (Tiger under the Table); and has written concert works for some notable singers, including Jane Manning, Jessye Norman, Dawn Upshaw, Alice Coote, Ailish Tynan and Ruby Hughes. She has composed Concertos for Piano (William Howard) and Oboe (Celia Craig).

In recent years, Judith Weir has considerably expanded her choral catalogue, with regular performance by choirs worldwide of music such as her Christmas carol Illuminare, Jerusalem written for Stephen Cleobury and the choir of King's College Cambridge. As associate composer with the BBC Singers (2015-19) she completed two oratorios; In the Land of Uz, about the prophet Job; and blue hills beyond blue hills, to Zen-influenced verse by the Scottish poet Alan Spence.

Now based in London, she has had a long association with Spitalfields Music Festival; and has taught as a visiting professor at Princeton, Harvard and Cardiff universities.

Honours for her work include the Critics' Circle, South Bank Show, Ivor Novello and Elise L Stoeger awards, a CBE then a Damehood and The Queen's Medal for Music.

In July 2014 Judith Weir was appointed to the 395-year-old royal post of Master of The Queen's Music, in succession to Sir Peter Maxwell Davies. Amongst her priorities in this role are the support of school music teachers, of amateur orchestras and choirs, and of rural festivals. In this role she has written music for national and royal occasions, including the Queen's 90th birthday celebrations, Platinum Jubilee and the UK's official commemoration of the 1918 Armistice. Since Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II died in September 2022, Weir is now Master of The King's Music and composed music for The Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey in 2023. Weir was awarded a Damehood in the 2024 New Year Honours list for her services to music.

She has also created new music for many community groups and schools, including Burntwood School Wandsworth, Aberdeen Art Gallery, St Mary's Church Dover and Greenacre School, Barnsley.

Judith Weir's music has been widely recorded, particularly on the NMC and Delphian labels; and is published by Chester Music and Novello & Co. Weir blogs about her cultural experiences at judithweir.com.

### Chester Music Ltd

Begin Afresh is a kind of diary, an almost continuous survey of musical reflections about the trees and plants I observed, in a very urban setting, over the period of a year. During my year of writing, starting in the spring, I had to break off twice, in early autumn and at the start of the new year; so I titled the three parts of this composition with the name of the month in which I started or restarted it - April, October and February.

My first impression, inviting me to begin the piece, was simply the sound in April of new leaves on branches moving in the wind; I realised I was hearing the repeated “afresh” sound at the end of Philip Larkin's poem, The Trees;

### "Last year is dead, they seem to say, Begin afresh, afresh, afresh.”

1. April often refers to this refreshing aural moment. Big textures suddenly cut away to reveal very quiet, almost inaudible movement.

II. October observes the heaviness of trees still in leaf amidst increasing darkness.

III. February begins by considering the depth and strength of tree roots, despite the opposition of cold and darkness.

These impressions may seem generic - they're tree events I look forward to every year. But I should add that the year 2022 contained a horrible event I hadn't seen before: leaves falling in August after the extreme heat and drought of that summer. J.W.

“Though trees themselves are necessarily static, Weir's three-movement score is anything but. It ripples sinuously in the spring, with almost a concertante role for lead violin Igor Yuzefovich, pulses mysteriously in the autumn, and is full of mostly quiet activity even in midwinter. Begin Afresh, a title drawn from Philip Larkin, is delicately scored and its ideas are always evolving in a recognisably traditional way” Martin Kettle, The Guardian

I started to write this piece with nothing but the opening melody in mind. As I arranged this apparently simple material for an initial ensemble of four solo violas and cello, the intertwining lines seemed to be sprouting musical leaves; or, in other words, interesting melodic and harmonic fragments were being generated almost as if in a process of nature. After observing a few more pages of these self-propagating complications take shape, I decided on the title Forest. Nearly everything in the piece has grown from the tiny musical seeds encountered in the opening bars, and the composition has unfolded in a particularly natural and organic way.

Within the final pages, a different, more distinct world is occasionally glimpsed. Perhaps this is the forest of folklore and prehistory, rather than the animated and burgeoning biological site examined in the man part of the music. On reaching the conclusion, a region of faint string chords, I felt rather like a fairy tale character pressing deeper and deeper into a mysterious prospect of trees. J.W.

"Weir's 13-minute, quasi-Romantic tone poem Forest was satisfying, its dense tuttis and thick, reiterated harmony genuinely allowing one to imagine the large and necessarily wood-dominated orchestra as the entity of the title"

Paul Driver, The Sunday Times

Text by Chuang Tzu (4thC BCE) from The Inner Chapters [English] Soprano + 3(pic,afl)333(cbn)/4301/timp.2perc/hp/str

Alt: soprano and piano

Full Score (CH79574) and Vocal Score on sale (CH79574-01) Chester Music Ltd

Natural History is a setting, for soprano and large orchestra, of four brief texts taken from Chuang-tzu, a classic collection of Taoist writings from the 4th, 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE. The oldest of these writings are known as The Inner Chapters, ascribed to Chuang-Tzu himself; and it is from this section of the work that all the texts of Natural History have been selected.

My interest in Chinese philosophical literature began in my teens, and was directly inspired by my enthusiasm for the writings of John Cage, in which ancient Chinese ideas are frequently connected to musical models. The texts of Natural History (which I have considerably compressed, from the translation by A C Graham) are typical of the qualities I most enjoy amongst this literature; concision, clarity, lightness and (hidden) wisdom. All four texts are short parables about natural life as lived by different species, human and animal; a Taoist Carnival of the Animals, in fact.

I am well aware that my own interpretations of these ancient wisdoms may be idiosyncratic, and spring from an avowedly Western sensibility. But nevertheless, these are ideas with which, in my own way, I have long been familiar; and I have for some time considered Taoism to be the most helpful of established philosophies in the conduct of modern life.

17

Lucy Crowe with Simon Rattle and the LSO.

Mark Allan

In choosing texts for Natural History, I aimed to find words which would allow both clear storytelling and opulent singing; in fact several of the songs might be said to approximate to the pattern of ‘recitative and aria'. The relatively large orchestra (triple woodwind, full brass but with no trombones, harp, percussion and strings) provides, in effect, the naturalistic scenery for these stories.

1. Horse. The text discriminates between the natural behaviour of wild horses and the unfortunate consequences of training them. An analogy with the behaviour of people is unspoken but implied. The music underlines this idea with an elegaic opening for an ensemble of three solo celli; followed by exacting rhythmic patterning in the ‘trained' section.

2. Singer. This is the story of a singer who lived (as many musicians do) in the most

straitened, poverty-stricken circumstances; but he possessed a magnificent voice, and was therefore, in Taoist reality, richer and greater than anyone else. A contrast is made between the careful spare orchestration of the opening and the huge orchestral fanfares punctuating the singer's 'aria'.

3. Swimmer. At the opening of the song, a man is glimpsed swimming, and perhaps drowning, in the throes of a massive and rocky orchestral chasm. But in mid-song, he climbs out of the waters and sings to his interlocutor (who happens to be Confucius) a jaunty melody (in 7/8 rhythm) in which he explains his simple mastery of the waves.

4. Fish/Bird. A giant creature of incredible dimensions, which appears as both fish and bird, is described in a passage which seems to me to describe our uncomprehending perceptions of the infinite. The orchestral accompaniment, dominated by high instruments, reminds me of the vapour trails of aircraft, stretched out over a blue sky. J.W.

“Weir's Natural History is 'Taoist Carnival of Animals', four settings of short Confucian parables that make their points gently and undogmatically. It makes no attempt to evoke chinoiserie in the music. These are deft, serious songs, beautifully judged and sparingly scored. Every gesture, every nuance counts."

Having played the oboe myself as a young person, the composition of an Oboe Concerto had an almost autobiographical significance for me. It was also a memory exercise, as I recalled in detail some of the music I had learned so carefully during those years. One important work, the Strauss Concerto, was helpful with my choice of accompanying instruments; just a wind octet plus strings.

My Concerto is in two movements. The first begins with the oboe more or less solo, flying lyrically through the open air, though soon in dialogue with the strings. The orchestral winds enter unobtrusively, one by one until gradually approaching the first of two major tuttis. After the second of these (which contrasts strong orchestral sentences with almost brutal oboe attacks) the music winds down, again lyrically, and with the oboe nearly always in the foreground.

The second movement could be compared with a passacaglia structure; an orchestral grid that repeats multiple times, but always in transformed scoring, for strings and (later on) bassoons only, with ornamentation by the oboe soloist. Some of the baroque and early classical concertos I used to play (for instance that by Cimarosa) were influential on the melancholy but also dance-like feel of this music.

Finally the winds re-enter with a short sequence of scherzo-like noises, before an extended, up-tempo coda brings the music to its conclusion with, once more, the oboe fluently in the foreground. J.W.

"...this piece confirms Weir's integrity: she writes what she wants to write, impervious to the criticisms of those who might disdain tonality. There is much sophisticated lyricism in this concerto, and real feeling.”

Hannah Nepilova, The Financial Times

### Chester Music Ltd

In the Land of Uz is a dramatised reading of the biblical Book of Job, from which all the text is taken, in the musical form of a cantata, or short oratorio. The majority of the music is sung by the chorus, but there are also 'obbligato' roles for a small group of instruments which appear singly or in pairs; viola, double bass, soprano saxophone, trumpet, tuba and organ. Job appears from time to time as a solo tenor; his thoughts are also represented by the viola. Although the bulk of the storytelling is undertaken by the chorus, a speaking narrator also makes occasional appearances.

1. Prologue. In a contest of strength, God and Satan conspire to test the faith of Job, a God-fearing and comfortably settled inhabitant of the Land of Uz. First Satan destroys Job's family, animals and possessions. When Job retains his dignity and refuses to curse God, Satan smites him with a plague of boils. The solo viola joins in his song at this point, and becomes his 'alter ego'. In extreme physical discomfort, Job insists that whatever happens to us, we must take the rough with the smooth.

2. Lament. Job, together with the viola, expresses his sadness, curses the day of his birth, and longs for death. Here his words are sung by the whole chorus.

3. Job's Comforters. Job's friends (sung here by different groupings of the chorus) arrive at the scene, and are at first compassionate, urging an optimistic outlook. They are joined by a saxophone and double bass. Later, their argument hardens; God is always right, so Job must have done something wrong. Job continues to express his dark view of the inevitability of decay and death.

4. Where is Wisdom? This famous and beautiful biblical chapter takes the form of an interlude, inviting a discussion about the elusive nature and scarcity of wisdom. But at the conclusion (to a huge organ entry) God's superiority is once again declared.

5. The Whirlwind. A vigorous duet for trumpet and organ.

6. God Speaks. Out of the whirlwind, God (represented by the male voices of the chorus and the tuba) speaks and re-asserts his authority. Who was it, after all, who created the universe in the first place, he argues, citing the many wonders of the natural world? Job withdraws from the argument with continued dignity and diplomacy.

7. Conclusion. Impressed by Job's composure, God engineers a sudden revival of his fortunes. His possessions are amply restored, making him twice as prosperous as he was before. He has a new family of sons and daughters, and sees several generations prosper, having himself lived to the age of 140. The voices quietly withdraw from the scene, concluding: 'So Job died, being old, and full of days'.

...a major achievement... The music's sparseness of utterance and spellbinding narrative command bring to mind some of Stravinsky's masterly late works, also biblically inspired, such as A Sermon, a Narrative and a Prayer and Abraham and Isaac." Malcolm Hayes, BBC Music Magazine

O Sweet Spontaneous Earth is a suite for chorus and string orchestra. The three movements set texts, by historical American poets, whose themes I have often referred to in earlier compositions. Each poem is about the Earth, and our experience of living on it.

O sweet spontaneous by E. E. Cummings (1894-1962) talks about the Earth's persevering efforts to regenerate itself despite the depredations of its inhabitants; the movement ends with an extended anthem on the word “spring”. Peace on Earth by William Carlos Williams (1883-1963) speaks of the magnificent constellations of stars shining in the sky above us while we sleep peacefully. The music borrows this contrast; energetic stars speeding through space, quietly immobile humanity beneath them. I reason, Earth is short by Emily Dickinson (1830-1886) ponders the short time we actually spend on Earth, and what happens afterwards. I borrowed the hymn-like feel of the poem to write a three-verse chorale, thoughtful in character, similar to the ending of a Bach cantata. J.W.

13th century China in the era of Kublai Khan and Marco Polo is the setting for this three-act opera. At the heart of the drama is a re-telling of the Yuan dynasty play The Chao Family Orphan by Chi Chun-hsiang. Chao Sun, explorer and mapmaker, leaves his city of Loyan for exile. His son Chao Lin is charged with the construction of a canal. Some actors are among his workers. The night before departure they enact The Chao Family Orphan. In the play, the wicked General Tu-an-Ku provokes the suicide of his servant Chao and his wife, leaving their young son an orphan. Unwittingly, the General adopts and raises the child. Twenty years later they conspire to overthrow the emperor. The orphan discovers his identity through a friend of his parents and vows revenge. After the play, Chao Lin's work on the canal is acclaimed. While surveying, Chao encounters an old woman who tells of his father's fate. Chao immediately plots revenge. J.W.

Good Morning, Midnight is a five-movement song cycle for voice and 10-part ensemble. Although first sung by a mezzo soprano (Sarah Connolly, with Aurora Orchestra conducted by Nicholas Collon) it is also suitable for baritone voice.

All five poems (by Kathleen Jamie, Charles Simic and Giacomo Leopardi, bookended by two Emily Dickinson lyrics) describe the strange, affecting, sometimes beautiful experience of being awake and observant during the night. The instrumentation (string octet plus clarinet and bass clarinet) accentuates the dark but occasionally radiant impressions the poets report.

The poems are:

1. Good Morning, Midnight (Emily Dickinson)

2. Moon (Kathleen Jamie)

3. The Clocks of the Dead (Charles Simic)

4. Alla luna (Giacomo Leopardi)

5. Lightly stepped a yellow star (Emily Dickinson)

The duration of Good Morning, Midnight is around 20 minutes. The work was commissioned by Wigmore Hall with the support of André Hoffmann, and first performed in 2015. J.W.

"This new piece, a setting of five poems on the subject of night and moon-light, had the beautiful lightness of touch and shy expressiveness that make her best pieces treasurable. For a piece ostensibly devoted to night, the music was astonishingly radiant... Night is portrayed as consoling and tender, a tone exactly caught in Weir's music. The radiance of Weir's piece seemed to permeate the entire evening.”

I once read of an idea to establish a human colony on Mars which was at once visionary and practical. In order to acclimatise themselves, potential settlers would at first live together, sealed off from the human race on a remote Scottish island. This is the music of the Scottish colonisers, several generations later, marooned on a lonely and distant planet; the ancient forms of their national music almost completely lost in translation, with only the smallest vestiges of the national style remaining. Three traditional melodies are quoted, but as if refracted through space time, far distances and strange atmospheric effects. These are 'The Leys of Luncarty' (heard on the horn in the opening Strathspey); 'Ettrick Banks' (played on the clarinet in the Traditional Air) and 'Miss Margaret Graham of Gartmore's Favourite' (played by everyone in the Jig).

Folklore is full of stories about people who suddenly disappear from home, never to return. Distance and Enchantment is a musical essay about this strikingly common occurrence. It takes the form of two meditations on traditional songs, which are played together without a break, amounting to a single movement of eleven minutes duration.

The first song, The Dark-Eyed Gypsy, from Northern Ireland, tells of a woman who, of her own volition, leaves her comfortable home to roam the unknown world with a band of gypsies; and the second, A ghaoil.lig dhachaigh gu m’mathair mi from South Uist, Scotland, tells of a girl who wanders a little too far from home on a dark night and is stolen away by the fairies.

The story of the Norwegian invasion of England in 1066 led by King Harald 'Hardradi', which ended in defeat at the battle of Stamford Bridge, nineteen days before the successful Norman invasion at the Battle of Hastings.

It is a 3-act opera based, as is a good deal of 19th century opera, on an actual historical event; in this case, the Norwegian invasion of England in 1066 led by King Harald ‘Hardradi', which ended in defeat at the battle of Stamford Bridge, 19 days before the successful Norman invasion at the Battle of Hastings.

As it is scored for solo soprano and lasts just under ten minutes, a certain amount of compression has been necessary. The soprano sings 8 solo roles, as well as the part of the Norwegian army; and none of the work's musical items lasts over a minute. Furthermore, since it would be difficult to stage a work which progresses so quickly, the soprano gives a short spoken introduction to each act to establish the staging, as might happen in a radio broadcast of a staged opera.

The musical items are as follows: Act 1 - Harald (aria), Fanfare, Tostig (aria); Act 2 - St Olaf (aria), Harald (aria), Harald's wives (duet); Act 3 - the Norwegian Army (chorus), Messenger (recit), Soldier (aria); Epilogue - the Icelandic sage (recit).

Much of the detail in the libretto has been taken from the account of the invasion in the 13th century Icelandic saga Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson (1179-1241).

King Harold's Saga was written in 1979 and commissioned by Jane Manning with funds provided by the Arts Council of Great Britain. J.W.

King Harald's Saga... embodies the qualities that still define Weir's musical thinking: her concern to tell stories, her ability to distil musical and dramatic ideas to their essences, and her creation of an idiom that's full of expressive subtlety but is never anything less than richly communicative.”

Nuits d'Afrique was written as a companion piece to Ravel's Chansons madécasses and shares its instrumentation; soprano, flute, cello and piano.

In response to Ravel's texts (by Évariste de Parny, who claimed that his ‘Madagascar Songs' were translations from folk sources, although he had never been there), I searched for poetry by contemporary African women, and found it in Irène Assiba d'Almeida's French-language anthology A Rain of Words.

The three writers represented here, Fatou Ndiaye Sow, Véronique Tadjo and Marie-Léontine Tsibinda come from Senegal, Ivory Coast and Congo-Brazzaville respectively. All were born in the 1950s. The poems evoke local life: a lullaby, the sound of drums, the appearance of a crocodile. The final poem, describing the continuity of village life, closes with a simple invocation which may recall the ending of Ravel's composition.

Nuits d'Afrique is warmly dedicated to Ailish Tynan. My thanks also to Michel Vallat for his advice about French prosody. J.W.

Score on sale (NOV360071)

Novello & Co Ltd

Having always admired the famous Impressionist water studies for piano - Debussy's Reflets dans l'eau - I had the idea of writing a water study for organ. This 4-minute organ piece is based on the intervals of the traditional Scottish air Ettrick Banks (not particularly audible in the finished piece) and seems to describe a more turbulent stretch of water than the French pieces mentioned above. Therefore, in homage to another piano water study, Liszt's Les jeux d'eau à la Villa d'Este, I have subtitled my piece Les chutes d'eau à la ville d'Ettrick.

Ettrick Banks was written for Michael Bonaventure, who gave me invaluable assistance and encouragement in writing for the organ. J.W.

### Novello & Co Ltd

The title of this music is an over-literal translation of the title of Francois Couperin's harpsichord tutor of 1716, L'art de toucher le clavecin. It seemed appropriate for a piece which begins with the player pressing single keys tentatively, as if encountering the instrument for the first time, and ends ten minutes later with the same repeated notes marked ‘confident and relaxed'. In the interim, the music, which is in a single continuous movement, demonstrates the many ways in which the piano keys can be touched, from the gentlest of strokes to the most vicious of blows.

A significant proportion of the songs were collected from prisoners - mostly black prisoners in Southern jails. The piece is made up of freely composed cello ‘fantasias' inspired by five of these songs: No.1 (Make Me A Garment) is based on a song sung by a prisoner in Florida who was found by the Lomaxes in the tuberculosis ward and could only whisper his song.

No.2 (No Justice) is a set of variations, using extended playing techniques, grownig out of a simple prison song from Georgia (original title ‘Oh we don't get no justice in Atlanta'). No 3 (The Wind Blow East) comes from fragments of a chorus heard in the Bahamas - it represents the prisoner's dream of a better life.

No.4 (The Keys To The Prison) is based on an original song sung by a 15-year old (Cajun) girl in French. In the song, a boy in prison sings to his mother, ‘Hey mom, I've got the keys to the prison and I'm going to escape'. She says 'How come, when the warders have the keys hanging round their necks?' and so it goes on. The music composed around it is very fast and agile, and for me represents the prisoner's fantasy that the prison doors are suddenly wide open, and the guards have all gone.

No.5 (Trouble, Trouble) is a transcription/arrangement of a blues sung by a prisoner in Alabama. J.W.

# Missa Del Cid

(1988) 25'

Text in English by Judith Weir, from the Spanish epic ‘Poema de Mio Cid' (13thC) and from the Latin Mass

Narrator and SAAATTTBBB chorus unaccompanied

Score on sale (CH58776)

## Chester Music Ltd

Missa del Cid was written in 1988, as part of BBC TV's 'Sound on Film' series, which showed the first performance of the piece in its entirety, together with a documentary about its creation. Subsequently, the work (originally written for ten solo voices) has reappeared in several other guises; performed live in concert, recorded on CD, and staged as part of an operatic evening about the era of the Crusades.

The text of the piece has two sources which at first may seem completely contradictory; a version of the Latin mass, and a short selection from the vast Spanish medieval epic poem Poema De Mio Cid which chronicles the life and times of the legendary warlord and outlaw Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, now known to us (via Hollywood and Charlton Heston) as El Cid.

The Cid, who lived in the second half of the eleventh century, was edged out of the court of Castile and at first fought on the side of the Moorish Emir of Saragossa (the title 'Cid' is said to come from the the Arabic Sayyidi, ‘My lord'). But the Cid later changed sides, and began to besiege the Moorish city of Valencia. It is in this frame of mind that he is found in the poem, jubilantly menacing the Moors at every opportunity, whilst justifying his violent deeds as devotion to the Christian religion, ridding the world of infidels.

The Cid's pugnacious Christianity is often hilarious in its extremity; but similar statements combining religious fervour and blood lust have often been heard, even in our own time, on the eve of battle. In Missa del Cid I set out to 'showcase' this absurd and dangerous contradiction in a piece which combines a few of the Cid's exploits (related by a speaking 'Evangelist') with a choral mass setting.

The opening Kyrie takes place in the besieged city of Valencia; its long, yearning lines are marked 'like a Muezzin's call to prayer'. The Gloria, in a cheerful 6/8 rhythm, echoes the Cid's relish for a good fight in God's name. In the Credo, the Cid's family go to church, and the Cid's wife sings a passionate prayer for his safety. During the Sanctus, the Cid is visited in his dreams by the Angel Gabriel, who advises him to ride out into battle and certain victory. The battle takes place during the Benedictus; and the Agnus Dei simply indicates tombstones, surrounded by silence and desolation. J.W.

Missa del Cid

Here begins the story of the great deeds of the Cid of Vivar. His men were Evangelist: Fich beyond all reckoning. After the Cid had left Saragossa, he passed through Huesa and the lands of Montalban, and occupied the pass of Olocau. Then he moved towards the sea to start fighting there, for the sun rises in the east and he turned in

The Cid took Jérica, Onda and Almenara, and he conquered the whole of the country round Burmand. He did all this with God's help, and when he Captured Murviedro he was sure the Creator was on his side. Within the walls of Valencia, great fear spread.
