# PUBLIC ABSTRACT

Issues surrounding diversity and inclusion have received increased attention in our contemporary society, influencing Western classical music education and concert programing by professional ensembles. Considering current literature on issues of diversity in the context of the Western classical musical canon and the particularly dominant gendered stereotypes surrounding composers and double bassists, this essay furthers the discussion of gender in the context of the double bass.

Given the general unfamiliarity of significant pieces for double bass by women composers, which are typically excluded from our books, schools and concert settings, this dissertation aims to address gender diversity by providing an annotated catalog of compositions by women for the double bass and three case studies of the composers Joëlle Léandre, Sofia Gubaidulina, and Violeta Dinescu.

This catalog includes solo and chamber pieces limited to five players, and it is supplemented with indexes that classify its contents by title, instrumentation, geographic region, and chronology. The goal of this dissertation is to make works for the double bass by women composers more accessible by providing reliable references to scores and recordings. Additionally, this compilation will encourage present compositions that can include and stimulate diverse performances for the double bass.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION

Roughly fifteen years ago, Andrew Kohn, professor of double bass at West Virginia

University, published a list of women composers in Bass World, the magazine issued by the International Society of Bassists, raising awareness in regards to gender inclusion in the instrument's repertoire.¹ Kohn's list included approximately two hundred names of women composers and raises the following questions: (1) “what are specific gendered views of music?”, (2) “are there feminine views of the bass and feminine sorts of compositions for the bass?”, (3) "are there feminine bassists or feminine cultural systems involving the bass?", and (4) "what have women contributed to the bass?” These are all legitimate questions. Historical gender inequality has surrounded women composers' careers and the role that gender plays for instruments such as the double bass, low brass, and percussion. Kohn's list registers only two works dated before 1900 and it is noticeable how expansive it becomes when it approaches the present, exemplifying the growing acceptance of women composers in classical music and shifting attitudes toward the double bass.

Kohn's publication in Bass World has been a great source of inspiration for this study, which started as an attempt to compile and discover pieces for one of my DMA recitals, a performance conceived to feature only female composers of music for the bass. The process of finding reliable references to pieces and recordings was not easy, and it made me question the importance of the accessibility of scores in fueling diverse choices in music making. Kohn's list was a very important part of my research process for that recital, and it is absolutely pertinent to

the gender issues in our bass world, providing information that furthers the discussion of the

topic of women composers.

# Statement of Purpose

The purpose of this project is to compile and publish a comprehensive catalog of works by women composers for the double bass. With the idea of facilitating future research, urging diversity and calling attention to the need for gender inclusion in the double bass repertoire, this comprehensive catalog includes extra features such as WorldCat OCLC reference numbers and recording references. My goal is to provide a catalog that helps the reader to easily encounter pieces according to instrumentation, style, title, region, and chronological order. The catalog is also contextualized by three case studies of three selected composers, whose outputs represent different styles of musical material and treatment of the instrument.

The issue of gender inequality is aggravated specifically in the double bass world due to the fact that players of the instrument have historically been predominately men, and most of the techniques and repertoire developed for the double bass were standardized by men. Although the number of female bass players has increased significantly in the past twenty to thirty years, it is still very difficult to find women bassists in professional orchestras, holding academic positions, or as finalists in large scale competitions. It is of additional concern that this lack of representation might be associated with the fact that it is very rare to encounter bass performances that include the compositions of a woman. As bassists, we are not diverse enough

in our choice of repertoire, and this misrepresentation causes the continuing idea that there are

not good enough works composed by women.³ This catalog is an effort to overcome this

gendered gap resulting from the exclusion of women composers from the standard repertoire of works for the double bass.

By providing access to reliable information about composers, scores, and recordings, this dissertation provides information that has been neglected in the instrument's performance settings and encourages future generations to explore a diverse approach in their recitals and curriculum development. This catalog and the promotion of gender diversity in the double bass world represent only a first step to achieving full inclusion of women composers in the Western classical music tradition.

# Review of Literature

In the context of classical music, gender disparity can be identified in ideological and practical levels, represented by ongoing challenges to integration of female composers in the mainstream of Western European music. The struggle to include women in the canon can be attributed to multiple problems embedded in our historical social experiences such as education, performance contexts, patronage, etc. With that in mind, it is important to recognize that our standard schools of music and work environments are still not diverse enough, whether in gender, class, disability, or ethnic representation.

It is relevant that the urge to increase diversity and inclusion in classical music settings is an existing worry in United States' universities and symphony orchestras. For this reason, the selected literature for this paper varies from broader issues of inclusion in music to topics of historical gender inequity and stereotyping in instrumental choice. These scholars discuss

challenges to the promotion of diversity presented by traditional approaches to the Western classical music canon. Finally, the following literature highlights contemporary discussions in the field of music education that tend to aim for a more humanitarian approach in schools of music.

# Diversity and the Western Classical Music Canon

In 2017, Jesse Rosen, President and CEO of the League of the American Orchestras, posted an open letter arguing that “orchestras' long-term artistic and institutional health” is dependent upon their "sustained commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.”4 Earlier that same year, Rosen gave a speech at the Association of British Orchestras (ABO) annual conference where he claimed that “if we want music to fully contribute to the democratic process, then I think we need to consider how the concert experience can be welcoming to all, not just our traditional audiences. And if we want to figure out how to address these admittedly complex challenges, then we must reach out to other voices besides our own.

95

During his presentation at the ABO conference, Rosen acknowledged the ethnic and gender reality among orchestras in the United States in which persons of color are underrepresented by a large margin. He also addressed the issue that little has changed over the past twenty years, despite efforts to improve commitments to multiculturalism. While gender equality has definitely increased among instrumentalists, positions such as conductors and board members still continue to be overwhelmingly white and male. These observations about

inequality bled Rosen to question the role of orchestras in addressing diversity issues within classical music culture.

According to Rosen, if we want to think about inclusion, we must ask “who the arts are for" and "how resources are distributed.” He finds answers to these questions in the writing of Martha Nussbaum, who argues that the arts and humanities are key to “the ability to think critically, the ability to transcend local loyalties and to approach world problems as a citizen of 96

the world, and finally the ability to imagine sympathetically the predicament of another person.

For Rosen, democracy needs more of the humanities, and to achieve that, we should broaden our horizons in our approach to music.

The concept of the musical canon seams to represent the ideological adversity that minorities must face in Western classical music. In 1987, Allan Bloom published The Closing of the American Mind, which featured conservative statements about how abandoning the Western canon and promoting equality, and stamping out racism, sexism and elitism was problematic to the curricula of U.S. universities. The impact of his criticism was substantial enough in the 1990s that the philosophical war surrounding the canonic tradition hoisted against the promotion of diversity became a duality of the new versus the old, the left versus the right, relativism versus rationality. The topic was discussed by many scholars and it, of course, influenced musical studies as well. In the early 1990s, Katherine Bergeron and Philip Bohlman addressed the issue of the canon, defining it as a “measuring stick.”” Similarly, in a 2007 essay marking twenty years since the publication of Bloom's book, New York Times journalist Rachel Donadio described the canon as something that creates boundaries and implies repetitions when being legitimated in

critical and ideological terms. The canon is a system that orders, divides, and segments; it is easily recognizable in repertoire programs and requirements at a typical school of music in the United States. Its existence might be observable in different levels in our society as well, and it is the source of most of the diversity problems identified in the classical music contexts of the twenty-first century.

William Weber wrote about the concept of the canon in 1999, highlighting different types of principles applied to its conception, among them, repertoire, craft, and criticism. According to Weber, the ideological canon demands a complicated analytical process and it defines what is popular and classical, what is moral, spiritual and civic. Weber emphasized this ideology as a means to understand how we build social values with the practice of the canon. The division that comes with the ideological canon supports cultural supremacy, justifying the predominance of Western elites over lower classes, which leads to rigidity and social divisions within modern society. This concept of canon can be associated with a traditional way of learning in our schools, one that emphasizes what is good and what is bad, what should be kept, and what shouldn't.

The idea of having disciplined a body of repertoire that somehow controls and divides makes it simpler for a complex story to be told. The field of classical music is focused on Western European traditions that are mainly rooted in compositions by white, male composers. How are we supposed to inspire women and minorities in the field if “their own” achievement is rarely represented in concert hall? So, coming back to Bloom and the canon/diversity war, a

question still needs to be answered. Is there a way we can find balance between criticizing our

traditions and opening up for new and diverse music while trying to protect and respect the

discipline and the artful construction of music?

In her introductory chapter to the book, Redefining Music Studies in an Age of Change: Creativity, Diversity and Integration, Patricia Sheehan Campbell, raises the question of what it means to be an educated musician in the twenty-first century. 10 Among other concerns, she explores the idea of a curriculum engaged in an interdisciplinary approach that is ecological and that highlights cultural sustainability and social justice. Campbell divides her ideas into three areas: (1) the essential purpose of music study, (2) the nature of foundational musical experience, and (3) the content of curriculum, music engagement, and leadership. While promoting this structural change, Campbell opposes the devaluation of the European tradition and instead proposes new levels of rigor and excellence created through emphasis on real world practices such as the artist's involvement with the community, creativity and improvisation. Campbell's argument represents a completely new way of understanding the role of the professional musician in our contemporary society and it is successful in recommending practical strategies to make that happen.

The strong tradition of canonic rigidity is still present in our schools, which concedes to exclusionary practices. Campbell's curricular framework suggests that if we want a real change to happen, there is still much to be done, starting with the way we shape our values and identify musicality. This catalog is inspired by this way of thinking, and it aims to facilitate access to create inclusion and to open further discussion into what it means to take a feminist and humanitarian approach to our performances and in our learning venues.

# The Issue of Women Composers

In 2018, forty-five significant music festivals from the European Union and Canada,

including the BBC's Proms, announced that by 2022 they will achieve a 50/50 balance in gender representation of composers whose works are commissioned and performed in their conferences. This initiative, called Keychange, aims to empower women and “to create much needed long- term change in live music and beyond.”11 Canada and the United Kingdom have become pioneers in disseminating women composers' music and publicizing commitments to diversity throughout their commissioning guidelines and universities' curricula.

While practical solutions are being promoted all over the world, we should acknowledge that the issue of gender inclusion is much bigger, and its lack stems from many societal factors that shaped and limited women's careers throughout the history of Western music. Most of these concepts were established or reinforced in the nineteenth century, such as differentiated education and job opportunities based on gender. 12 These factors have been the challenges to the success of female composers and to the acceptance of their voice.

The ideological construction of gendered roles and stereotypes has affected women composers throughout the years. Several examples can be used to illustrate this issue, but the clearest one is probably George Upton's book, Women in Music, which he published in 1880.13 Upton discusses the concerns that arose in Europe in the nineteenth century when women started

to aim for professionalism and to craft artful compositions. Upton was worried that with the

feminization of music there would be an inevitable deterioration of the art. According to Upton, women are naturally emotional and act through it, not being able to project themselves outwardly. "When the emotions lose their force with age, her musical power weakens,”14 he argues to justify the fact that women reach results mainly by intuition and they drop music before having gray hair, while men retain their abilities into old age. By believing that women's and men's brains are actually different, women were discouraged from having their own voices and to be creators, instead, they were encouraged to contribute to the success of the men around them, as supporters, sources of consolation, and inspiration as muses.

Another important example of diminishing women's capacities can be seen in the writing of Carl E. Seashore. After Upton's essay and other similar literature, psychologists started to try to understand and scientifically explain psychological differences between men and women. In 1940, Seashore acknowledged that all of the characteristics considered important for composition such as intelligence, creative imagination, endurance and temperament are the same for all humans, but he still believed in the idea of the “eternal feminine” in which the nature of women is passive, while the masculine nature is persistent and rational.15 These concepts are present in the way society organized women's education and obligations such as marriage and motherhood.

Furthermore, according to Nancy B. Reich, in the post-revolutionary world “women lost power. "16 For example, in 1804 the limitation of property rights to women and the ideas of motherhood and morality reinforced the concept that women were property of their husbands.

This "Cult of Domesticity,” as Reich terms this limitation on women's roles in society, allowed

women to execute, but not create.17 Such viewpoints impacted education, where teachers often took interest in the work of men, while women were encouraged to develop purely domestic skills. This gendered education model impacted curricula at the Paris Conservatory where women could only study two years in harmony, while men could take three years. It is not surprising that teaching jobs for women were not available in the composition area as well. Louise Farrenc, a remarkable nineteenth-century composer, could only work at the conservatory as a piano teacher, and then only in the women's section. According to Reich, in 1850, Farrenc had to ask for equal salary as a teacher in the Paris Conservatory. 18

A little later in 1933, Dame Ethel Smyth, a remarkable feminist English composer, wrote about women's “spiritual difficulties” indicating the extreme isolation of women composers. Smyth commented that “on a talented girl composer, the backwater frequenters will turn an indifferent, a patronizing, and perhaps inimical gaze.”19 This perspective shows the discouragement that young composers had at this time, and it represents the extra challenge that women have had to overcome in order to become professional composers.

A discussion regarding gender aesthetics in music criticism is likewise present in Women in Music: An Anthology of Source Readings. This type of criticism carries stereotypes in terms of gender, for example, the term feminine is what women should cultivate in music, which is the grateful, delicate, fuller melody and smaller forms of song. The term masculine should be powerful and intellectually rigorous in harmony, counterpoint and structural logic. A musical example can be seen in criticism to the 1896 premiere of Amy Beach's Gaelic Symphony in

Boston. Besides the fact that many critics mentioned that the piece was “creditable work for a

18 Ibid., 137.

10

woman, ,”20 musical critics from Boston registered that she probably had feelings of inferiority as

a female composer since there was a “excessive heavy orchestration,” claiming that Beach “must

be virile at any cost.”21 In this case, music becomes an inevitable result of her gender.

In her article, “Gender, Professionalism and the Musical Canon," Marcia J. Citron furthers this discussion observing that “large forms hold greater value than small forms, which are typically regarded as feminine.”22 Citron argues that it is not only necessary to promote women and incorporate female composers in the canon, but a larger structural change in our music education is needed. For that, we must look for a humanistic approach to musical studies, while trying to resist to a positivist way of understanding music. In this model, sociological, cultural, and historical approaches should be taken into consideration in developing a contextually-based, community-engaged musical society.

In order to challenge the idea that works by women composers are “unworthy of consideration for serious performance and study"23, we should be proactive in fueling inclusion of this repertoire. Otherwise, we risk “reinforce[ing] the inaccurate notion that there were no relevant pieces by women and doing so, might render more difficulty for women to emerge as creators in the future. "24

# Gender and the Double Bass

During the 2017 convention of the International Society of Bassists (ISB), Megan

McDevitt gave a lecture in which she highlighted gendered statistics in United States' symphony

orchestras and addressed how the bass is perceived as masculine. In her presentation, she

mentioned the importance of representation in encouraging young female performers in the 25

beginning of their career.

Similar to low brass and percussion, the double bass has long been considered a male- dominated instrument. Amy Phelps explored this issue in her 2010 dissertation, “Beyond Auditions: Gender Discrimination in America's Top Orchestras.” Phelps covered aspects of the history of women as instrumentalists and called the attention to the lack of female representation in certain sections of the orchestra, including the double bass section. In addition, she discusses the problem of gender stereotypes.

Female string bass players have not only chosen a large, cumbersome instrument deemed unfeminine by traditional stereotypes; but the string bass is also associated with jazz, which historically has implied a whole underworld of gritty nightlife. 26

Regarding the persistent association of masculinity with the double bass, Phelps mentions the world-famous bassist Esperanza Spalding. Spalding pointed out in an interview with The New Yorker that sometimes people even associate masculinity with quality of playing, mentioning the recurrent statement of: “Man, she's a monster, she sounds like a dude!”27 Phelps observes that "Spalding, along with many accomplished female performers, is ironically accused of being unfeminine if she plays well, but would be accused of being a weak, incompetent female if she is not successful."28

The double bass is the largest instrument in the string family, and it produces low

frequencies of sound. In addition, its role is associated with providing the basis or the harmonic

and rhythmic ground of an ensemble, which is often associated to the idea of masculinity. Examples of this association can be found in the classic 1923 book by Frederick H. Martens, String Mastery. Martens presents short essays from “the most valid opinion of the day, that of the distinguished virtuosos and teachers of the instruments.”29 In one interview with Ludwig Emanuel Manoly, a graduate of the Vienna Conservatory and faculty of the New York Institute of Musical Art. Manoly mentions the “beautifully sonorous and virile tone of the powerful contrabass register”30 and discusses the influence of physique in playing the instrument.

My first bit of advice is: Do not take up the doublebass unless you are physically strong, unless you have a good physique - for you will need it. In order to play the contra-bass or bass viol, the player must be muscularly well-developed.31

The point of view expressed by Manoly represents a typical stereotype of the double bass player: the strong, tall and, very likely, male player. Unfortunately, this portrait influenced further generations with common associations regarding the instrument, and it has been carried up to the present, directly affecting women's representation in the professional settings of the double bass.

While trying to understand the sources and origin of gender stereotype related to instrumentalists, many scholars have worked in a diverse set of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Mark E. Vickers32 contributed to the understanding of gender stereotype in instrumental choice, and Blair A. Williams³³ investigated the field of music education,

discussing the influence of external factors and psychology. Phelps also mentions the study of

Jason Zervoudakes and Judith M. Tanur regarding gender and musical instruments.

Musical instruments are gendered. Research indicates that regardless of whether we concentrate on who actually plays the instrument or on the images or stereotypes evoked by their names, certain instruments are considered feminine and others masculine, though which instruments are assigned to which gender seems to differ 34 over time and with various age-groups.

For several years, women have been affected by gender role play, which has caused an inherent lack of representation in double bass professional settings. Even though the number of female bassists has increased in the past several years, it is still rare to see women in professional orchestras and as finalists in major double bass competitions. According to McDevitt only 8.3% of people playing double bass in high level professional orchestras are female. 35This issue reflects the scopes of pedagogy of and composition for the instrument as well, and we can observe that most of the methods and literature developed for the double bass were written by men. Examples of that can be seen in the “Comprehensive Catalogue of Music, Books Recordings and Videos for the Double Bass”36 and in Bass World's bibliography of "Virtuosi of the Double Bass."37

As an attempt to encourage new compositions for the double bass by women, in 2018, Bass Europe (Lucca) international convention, there was a worldwide call for music by female composers, offering a prize for a newly-composer concerto. The winner was the piece Omaggio a Geminiani by Elena Cattini, which became a required piece for the Solo Competition final at the same convention.

Efforts have been made through institutions such as the International Society of Bassists

and Bass Europe to improve gendered barriers in the double bass world. However, it is unfortunate that the work and music of women composers from diverse styles and origins are still noticeable absent in concert halls, double bass recitals and schools' curricula across the country.

# Methodology

Andrew Kohn's list of women composers published in Bass World38 is not only a source of inspiration in this essay, but it also serves as a starting point for this catalog. Kohn's list is organized by composer's name and includes instrumentation, title, publisher and dates (if available). With the goal of facilitating the performance of and future research about these works, I expand upon Kohn's data by including country of origin and enabling access by listing OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) numbers for scores and recordings. The data for each piece will vary according to the availability of information about each composer and their work. In addition to adding data for the pieces listed by Kohn, I expand upon his list by cataloging works composed since the publication of Kohn's list or otherwise not included in his list.

According to Daniel Joudrey and Arlene Taylor, authors of the book Introduction to Cataloging and Classification, a catalog should enable the user to find, identify, and select bibliographic resources in a collection and obtain access to an item described. 39 My project aims to follow the several principles cited in this book, specifically the idea that a catalog should: (1) have authority control so that users may identify what they seek and easily navigate the system,

(2) contain enough metadata to allow users to select resources and to obtain those that they need,

(3) be easy to search, with clear instructions and with explanations of the comprehensiveness of a search, (4) provide accessibility to all users, regardless of whether they are sophisticated

computer users or whether they are persons who have disabilities.

A variety of annotated catalogs of music publications have been useful in helping me define the design and scope of a catalog of works for double bass by women composers. An Annotated Catalogue to Guitar Music by Female Composers40 and “A Catalogue of Viola Compositions by United States Women Composers ”41 are examples of these. These sources differ in the number and types of their indexes and several of them include publishers and library locations, but none of them provide specific WorldCat OCLC numbers. Discographies and brief biographies are only present in a few of the catalogs.

Another important catalog for this project is Judith Barger's Music in The Girl's Own Paper: An Annotated Catalogue, 1880-1910, which mentions composers of Britain in the nineteenth-century and includes additional annotations than the ones described above.42 The catalog contains stories about music compositions, illustrations, and several historical articles as an introduction to the standard chronological listing and indexes. In this case, annotations are an important feature as they provide the researcher with contextual information and reliable references about the works.

The structure of this catalog for double bass has a similar approach in format to that used in Heidi Boenke's Flute Music by Women Composers: An Annotated Catalog.43 It includes a

main alphabetical list with information about the works, followed by a title index, chronological index, geographical index and instrumentation index, dividing the works in solos, duos, trios, quartets, and quintets. This option of diverse indexes not only promotes accessibility, but also enough preliminary information that would help the performer to make a decision to perform a specific piece or a composer. Finally, this catalog also contains lists of publishers' information, composers' information, and a supplementary list of recordings, limited to albums that include pieces cited in the catalog.

The main alphabetical list of works includes the mandatory fields of (1) composer, (2) title, (3) instrumentation, and (4) source. A list of names is included in the Appendix section of this dissertation, mentioning the relevant persons encountered through this research that do not meet the mandatory fields or that could not be verified through references. The supplementary fields in this catalog are: dates, annotations, playing techniques, technical requirements, publisher, style or genre, technique level, commission, dedication, recording, OCLC number and online suggested recordings. Besides my own understanding about each piece, the annotations include when available, subtitles, premiere information, name of movements, form, main characteristics, tuning, type of notation, alternative instrumentation, editor's name, authorship of text or poetry, awards, score type (manuscript), and links to external sources. The catalog presented in this document is the first stage of an ongoing research project. A searchable online version of this catalog is maintained and updated at www.rebecafurtado.com.

It is important to mention that the designation of technique level is relative and was used infrequently in this catalog. The levels are broadly divided into Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. The beginner level incorporates method books and pieces for young bassists that go up to fourth position. The Intermediate level includes pieces with well-developed melodic

17

material in traditional notation and moderate use of thumb position. Lastly, the Advanced level

includes multitask pieces with use of extended techniques and complex rhythmic structures.

In order to facilitate future research, this dissertation includes WorldCat OCLC references. With the use of these numbers, a researcher can encounter a specific piece on WorldCat database, find extra information about the works, and determine which libraries own a copy. In addition, the OCLC numbers facilitate transactions of Interlibrary Loan between universities and libraries around the world, which will help performers access to the material presented in this catalog.

# Three Case Studies

This catalog consists of a diverse list of works by women composers for the double bass

and provides performers and researchers with pertinent information such as instrumentation, duration, playing techniques, and sources for obtaining scores of these works. It is important, however, that this project conceives of composers as individuals and investigates how their work may affect different spheres surrounding performances of and research about the double bass.

The following case studies consider the contributions of three women composers: French double bassist and composer Joëlle Léandre (b. 1951), Russian composer Sofia Gubaidulina (b. 1931), and Romanian composer Violeta Dinescu (b. 1953). These case studies present a contextualized approach of composers whose careers and works are related to the literature review of this essay.

Joëlle Léandre is as an artist who explores boundaries between composition and improvisation, engaging in a more flexible way of viewing music without the rigidity of the canon. Sofía Gubaidulina has significantly contributed to the double bass repertoire in the realms of exploration of techniques. Her work has stimulated theoretical research regarding embodiment in music. Finally, Violeta Dinescu is a composer who has composed a double bass concerto and developed a style of composition inspired by mathematics and Romanian folk music. Collectively, these women give voice to the double bass through their own perspectives in music, demonstrating diversity in their works and in their artistic endeavors.

## Joëlle Léandre – Exploring Boundaries between Composition and Improvisation

"Now is the life, today and not tomorrow. This

can be understood quite young, understood clearly. I can be an angry woman, and this is a good vibration. I can use inner rage to keep the utopia, the idea of changing the world. Artists have a job, to change the world"

- Joëlle Léandre44

With a strong background in classical music through years of training in the Paris Conservatory, double bass player Joëlle Léandre decided to pursue her unique musical path through engagement with improvised music, interdisciplinary performances, jazz, and composition. Léandre often expresses a distinct vision about the rigidity surrounding classical music repertoire, challenging the established system through a search for freedom that is evident in her work.

Léandre has more than 150 recordings to her credit, and she has worked extensively with chamber groups of new music such as Pierre Boulez's Ensemble InterContemporain, a highly- acclaimed progressive music ensemble in Paris. She has also commissioned and premiered works by several composers, such as John Cage and Giacinto Scelsi. Her contributions to the techniques, recordings, and repertoire of the double bass, are remarkable for their range and excellence.

Léandre's work is very fluid and takes different forms. For this reason, it is not a simple task to compile all of her compositions for the purposes of a catalog such as this one. Because of the highly improvisatory nature of her work, Léandre has published only a few scores of her own compositions. This catalog not only includes listings for Taxi, Octobre, and For Peter H., for which scores are widely available in libraries around the world, but also references selections

from her prolific discography as well as pieces listed on her website.

In an interview with Frances-Marie Uitti for the Contemporary Music Review, Léandre

explains that improvisation is often marginalized in conservatories and claims to be “polemic about this split between academic culture and institutional art.”45 According to Léandre, there is a relationship of power in the system surrounding music conservatories, in which students are not allowed to put themselves extensively into their works or freely play the music that is in their head without looking at a score.

When we are creative or improvise, we and even the students could be very sharp, on top of things, and then our approach to Mozart or Scarlatti would reflect more individuality. But the people and society don't want individuality, they want the mass-produced (...) But the academies don't wish this; they want to control the music business. It's the same in society every day. 46

A similar argument is featured on William Colangelo's dissertation “The Composer-performer Paradigm in Giacinto Scelsi's Solo Works.”47 In an interview with Colangelo, Léandre criticizes

the way music is fixed in a score in European culture, causing loss of individual freedom, lack of political involvement, and diminishment of embodiment in music. In opposition to the fixation of text in music, Léandre refers to Zen aesthetics, referencing the work of composer Giacinto Scelsi. According to her, Scelsi values the freedom of the interpreter by suggesting that they

should be true to themselves, and that they should play without lies or concerns about mistakes.

You have the freedom to be you, and this is very Zen, because [Scelsi] had all that philosophy, I could say, he was close to this thinking, Indian. You find a part of this way 48 to be you.

When the system surrounding conservatories places extra emphasis on the score, the idea

of embodiment tends to receive less attention in performances. According to Léandre,

improvisation allows the musician to express themselves more freely and to create art with their

bodies at the moment of the performance.

In improvisation you have, I could say, spontaneity, love, body, because composed music is too often this trilogy and this top on the top (pointing to head) and they forget this other I mean the soul, the head, and down, the body, the sex and everything. 49

The concept of exploring boundaries between composition and performance is something that

she applies to her work, and that extends to the idea of breaking the rigidity of the canon. Léandre defends the importance of freedom of interpretation and sees value in being a unique artist and being completely true to oneself while performing music. Her statements reflect a thoughtful and artistic personality, which has enabled her to become a pioneer in experimental music and improvisation. She has collaborated with painters, dancers, actors and writers in diverse settings and styles. In addition, she often express political and social opinion through her work.

In December of 2017, Léandre wrote a polemic open letter to the organizers of the annual “Les Victoires du Jazz” awards criticizing the lack of gender representation in mainstream music festivals. In a response to an all-male podium, Léandre accused the organizers of manufacturing the results as “a provocation or a charade.” 50 She affirmed that the judges of the French jazz awards should abandon ancient views and start listening, and paying attention to female musicians, instead of “congregating a self-congratulatory atmosphere.”51

Although this situation occurred in the context of a jazz festival, the same issues of representation can be observed in classical music and any improvisational setting, regardless of

22

genre. It is still very common to see all-male podiums and all-male finalists when the featured instrumentalist is the double bass player. 52 As a response to these issues of gender imbalance, Léandre takes an activist approach to her life and career.

Always committed to the value of music in mediating human interaction, Léandre's feminist perspective led to her involvement with a number of all-female musical groups. She was a member of the European Women Improvising Group (EWIG) in the early 80's, an avant-garde experimental group that emerged from the Feminist Improvising Group (FIG) in the late 70^{\prime}s. Léandre later co-founded Les Diaboliques, a prominent trio, improvisational in character, with vocalist Maggie Nichols and pianist Irene Schweizer. A brilliant interview with Les Diaboliques appeared in Julia Smith's interdisciplinary dissertation, “Diva-dogs: Sounding Women Improvising."53 In this interview, the trio reinforces views about the lack of gender representation in music festivals. According to them, there are plenty of women playing improvised music everywhere, but they are still not seen in festivals, and people think they do not exit.54 They also mention that, historically, men tend not to accept women as pioneers and innovators, which clearly affects the music scene of improvised music and composition.

In her dissertation, “The Myth of Absence: Representation, Reception and the Music of Experimental Women Improvisors”55 Dana Reason examines how media, journalism, and music criticism presents issues surrounding escaping the canon and promoting inclusion for women in improvisation. According to the study, there is a problem in the way women improvisors are

represented in media--largely in that women are absent from media coverage of musical improvisation--which reinforces the lack of women's activity in these traditionally male- dominated realms of musical performance. Furthermore, reason asserts that when someone is lining up a recital or a festival featuring only women, gendered perceptions lead to the

assumption of lower standards and that mediocre musicians have been hired, when this is not the

case.

Little has changed in the nearly twenty years since Reason's dissertation and media representations of women composers, improvisors and double-bassists continue to be largely absent. The works compiled in this catalog prove to be diverse in style, rich in quality and expansive in number. In the case of Joëlle Léandre, her music and personal statements illustrate a different way of understanding music, by inspiring composers and double bass players to be even more complete musicians and artists.

# Sofia Gubaidulina - Impact and Influences on the Double Bass

"The possibility for string instruments to derive pitches of various heights at one and the same place on the string can be experienced in music as the transition to another plane of existence. And that is joy"

- Sofia Gubaidulina56

The importance of the works of Sofia Gubaidulina for this research stems from her pioneering use of non-traditional compositional methods and exploration of extended techniques. Gubaidulina's fascination with percussion and low strings is indicative in the extensive number of works she has produced for cello, viola and double bass. Furthermore, because she is considered a first-class composer and for having her works being performed all over Europe and U.S. by leading ensembles such as The New York Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony, and the Chicago Symphony, Gubaidulina significantly calls our attention to the musical potentials of the double bass and its repertoire.

Canonic chamber music repertoire which includes the double bass is not as extensive as that for upper strings and wind instruments. One of the reasons for the lack of chamber music repertoire for double bass is that the instrument has been historically misunderstood and unexplored.57 The role of the double bass, and other historical versions of it, was traditionally rooted in providing the harmonic support and rhythmic accuracy to the ensemble, and it was only after the nineteenth century that melodic and freer parts started to appear in chamber works for the instrument.

With the development of modernism and postmodernism in the twentieth century, the possibilities of repertoire for the instrument expanded considerably. At this time, many double

bass virtuosos such as Serge Koussevitzky (1874-1951) consolidated their influence worldwide

.

and meticulously demonstrated new techniques that explored the potential of the instrument. Moving closer to the twenty-first century, composers such as Gubaidulina started to shift musical interests toward a timbrally experimental character, instead of a formal pitch-centered type of composition. The double bass and its wide range of possibilities of tone and harmonic richness began to be thoroughly explored, and it continues to be up to the present, remaining a common instrument choice for chamber music compositions based on new music aesthetics.

Gubaidulina's chamber and solo works often explore pitch clusters, micro-chromaticism, the use of gestures, improvisation, and free tempo combined with well-defined rhythmic structures. She frequently writes double bass parts that apply the use of extended techniques in exploring the broad timbral range of the instrument. For example, the bass player is instructed to play on different regions of the instrument and apply varying pressure to the string with the bow. She often includes non-traditional objects in the score, such as a “friction stick” in her Galgenlieder song cycle and a cup of glass in her piece, Sotto Voce.

The works of Gubaidulina have been analyzed and studied by scholars through many different lenses. Andreas Angell wrote a dissertation about her use of timbre, texture and spiritual symbolism; Valeria Tsenova discussed her use of numbers, Fibonacci series and Lucas sequence; and Colin Clarke has a publication in the magazine Fanfare discussing the CD,

“Chamber Music with Double Bass,” featuring bassist Martin Heinze and ten full chamber works by Gubaidulina including the double bass.58

Double bassist and music theory scholar Michael Berry's 2009 article, “The Importance

of Bodily Gesture in Sofia Gubaidulina's Music for Low Strings,” discusses the attention to the body in Gubaidulina's compositions. Berry examines the nature of gestures in music and provides a wonderful literature review on the topic. He defines gesture in three broad categories: expressive gestures, practical gestures, and cues. Moreover, he uses this subdivision to analyze works by Gubaidulina. One of the key concepts in Berry's article is “kinesthetic empathy,” which is when the movements of the musicians impact the listener. In this case, the performer is enabled through the composer's music to show periods of tension and relaxation to their audience.

For example, Berry analyzes the beginnings of Gubaidulina's works Sonata and Pantomime: the first one starts slowly in a low comfortable position, and the second one starts in a high register with the use of artificial harmonics. Pantomime's beginning suggests greater instability since the performer is probably not completely comfortable and concerned that the harmonics might not speak right away. This difference of approach is going to create aspects of tension or relaxation in the performance of the piece, that will likely be perceptible to the listener.

Another important example of embodiment in Gubaidulina's works including the double bass is her song cycle Galgenlieder (Gallows Songs). This piece has a movement called “Fisches Nachtgesang" based on a silent poem by Christian Morgenstern. The entire movement is written to be performed without sounds, only gestures. In this case, the composer creates a sign language or a "gestural system of communications”59 that allows the performers to successfully provide

the conveyed musical ideas to the audience.

59 Michael Berry, “The Importance of Bodily Gesture in Sofia Gubaidulina's Music for Low Strings,” Music Theory Online 15 (2009): 7.

27

The theory of embodiment in relationship to Gubaidulina has been applied to performance settings by bassist Megan McDevitt, who published a set of three dissertation- recitals including program notes with contextual information about the pieces and composers involved in the performances. Her final recital was titled “To Own a Body,” and she performed four of Gubaidulina's Eight Etudes for the Double Bass accompanied by two dancers, Paula Modafferi and Chloe Gonzales. In her program notes, McDevitt builds a relationship between embodiment in Gubaidulina's piece, with the concept of "body" as discussed by musicologist Suzanne Cusick in "Feminist Theory, Music Theory, and the Mind/Body Problem, 60which explores how masculine and feminine genders are associated with the mind and the body.

Undoubtedly, the work of Gubaidulina has a major impact in the double bass repertoire and in the theoretical sphere surrounding performances of her pieces. Several artists have recorded her works throughout the years, and her double bass Sonata can be heard by double bass players such as Martin Heinze, Daniele Roccato, Niek de Groot and Dan Styffe. Her use of symbolism and gestures in music have influenced both instrumentalists and theorists, and she continues to be an inspiration to many musicians who wish to explore innovative, thoughtful and deeper paths in music.

# Violeta Dinescu – Quarz Spiele, Mathematics and Romanian Folk

"One can dream in sounds. Then one can experience how sounds already exists within oneself. I try to bring to life these sounds which have already existed for a long time and are only inaudible for others." Violeta Dinescu 61

Inspired by sounds of her homeland in Romania, Violeta Dinescu frequently seeks artistic inspiration in poetry, visual arts, nature, and folk music. She studied mathematics and frequently explores compositional techniques based on mathematically analytical processes, seeking a coexistence between “strict construction and sensuousness of sound.”62 The music of Dinescu has often been described as spiritual, in association with “cosmic and sacred fields of energy.

963

Dinescu was born in Bucharest and studied piano, composition and music pedagogy at the Ciprian Porumbescu Conservatory under influential names in Romanian music such as Myriam Marbe, Emilia Comișel, and Alexandru Pașcanu. She is now the Professor for Applied Composition at the Carl von Ossietzky University in Oldenburg, Germany, where she initiated the Composer's Colloquium in 1996 and the Archive for East European Music in 2000. In addition, she leads composition workshops across Europe and North America, and promotes lectures on themes connected with Romanian music.

The catalog of compositions by Dinescu is extensive; she has composed ballets, silent- film music, music theatee, and pieces for large and small ensembles. Her instrumental works are conceptual, and they are sometimes adapted to different instruments. Such is the case for her compositions Abendandacht and Lytaniae, both of which are included in this catalog. The former piece was originally composed for trumpet and the latter for cello. However, both of these pieces

can be played on the double bass. Dinescu has received numerous awards for her work, and it

has been recorded by Trio Contraste, cellist Marcel Spinei, and violinist Marie-Claudine

Papadopoulos.

The work of Dinescu is the topic of the book edited by Eva-Maria Houben, Violeta Dinescu, which discusses ideas of interpretation, notation, and artistic inspiration in her music.64 Additionally, the magazine Neue Zeitschrift für Musik published articles about her in two consecutive years (2001 and 2002). The first one, written by Dagmar Zurek, deals with the duality of mathematics and aesthetics present in her music, and the second, by Karin Meesman, brings perspectives about new music and references to some of her pieces (Echoes I and II, among others). 65 The sources cited above are in German, even though her music has been thoroughly performed and recorded around the world, Dinescu's academic literature in English is unfortunately rare.

The style of composition investigated in Dagmar Zurek's article was further explored in the liner notes to Dinescu's album, Etudes de nuages (2008), in which Egbert Hiller66 establishes two sides in her music: the use of mathematics and the influence of Romanian history or folk music. According to Hiller, there is a “fascinating combination of structural thought, and points of contact with old traditions” in Dinescu's music. These two sides are not in conflict, but rather work together to enrich the music of Violeta Dinescu.

Specifics of this duality can be found in Dinescu's Lytaniae für Celli,67 an album recorded in 2014 by cellist Marcel Spinei. From the mathematical point of view, this is a piece

that was written for a five-string cello and has nine sections, each section composed for a

different number of cellos from three to fifty-three (featuring only prime numbers). In addition, Dinescu used Gerhard Richter's 66 paintings as a source of inspiration by meticulously measuring free planes in the paintings and equating millimeters with quarter-tones in certain parts of her music. Her idea was to approach degrees of intensity in music based on visual aspects of color and depth.

While mathematics is clearly utilized in the piece, Dinescu also searched for inspiration in sounds of the past of her homeland. Lytaniae uses an anonymous litany from the Codex Caioni collection from the Franciscan monk Ioan Căianu (Janus Cajoni or Johannes Kajoni), who lived in the seventeenth century in Romania. The collection contains sacred and secular pieces from western Europe and Transylvania, and it had been lost since World War II, and was only re-discovered in 1985.

Dinescu has conducted fieldwork throughout Romania in conjunction with ethnomusicologist Emilia Comișel, and she claims to have a strong connection with her homeland, even though she immigrated to Germany at a young age in 1982. According to Egbert Hiller, 68 aspects of what she experienced in Romania created a sense of identity for her, which reflects on the language of the sounds she has internalized. She draws upon these sounds in her compositions through a process of “intuitive access”69 to the internalized sounds, or what she calls, "living creatures."70 In this process, Dinescu makes use of folk music not necessarily as direct quotations, but rather, in an intuitive level, “located beyond nostalgia and romantic tendencies."71

71 Dinescu, Etudes de nuages.

31

Besides the nine pieces annotated in this catalog, Dinescu has written several other works

that include the double bass within larger ensembles, for example, Aïon; Du fond de mon Avenir; and Tempo di Walzer II. Her major work for the instrument is, perhaps, her double bass concerto, Quarz Spiele auf der Suche nach Mozart. The piece features careful treatment of the instrument, good orchestration, and musicianship. Quarz Spiele was composed for double bassist Thierry Roggen, who premiered the piece on a tour with the Bavarian Philharmonie through Switzerland, Austria, and Germany in January of 2010. According to Dinescu, the piece functions as a psychogram of different stones with echoes of Mozart. The seven stones are the titles of each movement of the concert: Trystin, Prasiolith, Quarzglas, Tridimyt, Schwingquarz, Dacit, and

## Reliefschnitt in Amethyst.

The piece was written to be played in BEAD (high D) tuning, which is something bassist Roggen has explored before in his performances, compositions, and arrangements.72 The tempo should be mostly free, and there are moments in which the rhythmic structures can be flexible, without the implied limits of notated measures. However, in order to avoid an absolute freedom of rhythm, there is often a “hierarchy" of note values, which is demonstrated in the notes of the score.

The double bass part is extremely active and technically demanding, with frequent use of artificial harmonics, glissando, and chromaticism. Although there is plenty of room for creativity and interpretation in this piece, the notation clearly specifies articulations and extended techniques throughout, with the use of a diverse and carefully defined symbology. For example, there are four types of vibrato intensity and tremolo intensity, and five types of contact point for the bow.

72 More information about Roggen's use of scordatura: www.roggenmusic.com.

32

Quarz Spiele auf der Suche nach Mozart is a significant contribution to the double bass

repertoire. It is perhaps one the first concertos written to be played in the scordatura BEAD on the double bass, and it demonstrates a distinct vision of the possibilities of the instrument, while exploring a contemporary language and rich treatment of sounds, not only for the double bass, but for the orchestra as an ensemble.

Ultimately, Violeta Dinescu is a remarkable composer who developed her own artistic language through her sense of identity and close relationship with mathematics. She is inspired by abstract art and brings unique sounds to her pieces. Dinescu shows affectionate treatment of the double bass through the composition of a concerto dedicated for the instrument and a diverse set of chamber music works including the double bass.

# Conclusion

Léandre, Gubaidulina, and Dinescu are composers with distinct artistic views. Each one of them represents a composer who created diverse and significant contributions to the double bass repertoire and its performances. The three case studies reinforce the idea that each of the composers cited in this annotated catalog can be studied and investigated with the objective of enriching future performances settings with double bass works by women composers.

Duas Miniaturas Brasileiras (arrangement)

Duration: 5'

Publisher: Assunto Grave

Number of Performers: 2

Annotations: Original composition by Chiquinha Gonzaga. Two contrasting movements, one very catabile and expressivo and the other, an energitic dance-like maxixe. I - Lua Branca - da opereta "O Forrobodo" (White Moon - from the opereta "O Forrobodo" II - O "Corta-Jaca". The premiere of "Corta-Jaca" happened in 1914 at the presidential palace with the collaboration of the first lady on the guitar. This episode was considered a scandal at the time. The critics disapproved the lifestyle at the palace and the dissemination of music whose origins were from "vulgar" dances, contrary to the values of the aristocratic social elite.

# Diesendruck, Tamar

Stroll

Instrumentation: db

Duration: 5'

Number of Performers: 1

Annotations: Use of triplets, quintuplets and syncopation. Groovy and jazzy atmosphere, reinforced by the use of percussive "short noise" notes (stopping strings with hands). The piece displays higher registers of the bass in pizzicato which are sometimes ornamented by slides. "Laid Back". The piece slowly brings musical ideas to lower registers of the bass until it finally introduces the bow, still accompanied by left hand noise. Overall short thematic material, emphasis on rhythm.

Lytaniae I

Date of Composition: 2010 Instrumentation: db

Duration: 6'

Publisher: Grafik: Rima Chahine, Handschrift: Violeta Dinescu, Layout: Clemens Kohne Number of Performers: 1

Annotations: Lytaniae I is a "Variant fur Kontrabass" original for cello, and a fragment from Folio 191 nr. 329. Dinescu used material from "Codex Caioni" or "Johannes Caioni" (1629-87) who was a Transylvanian Franciscan monk, musician and Roman Catholic priest. The piece is characterized by an intense ostinato of long open strings, it starts on the G string, moving to D, A, and, finally E. The open strings are held throughout the music and small interventions are added to it. The interventions can be glissandos on the other strings, tremolos or short accented notes. Percussive effects and noisy sounds are indicated in the score.

# Satya III

Date of Composition: 1981 Instrumentation: db

Duration: 7'

Number of Performers: 1

Annotations: Satya III is probably the most well-known work for the double bass by Violeta Dinescu. The music is part of a set called "Satya" for different solo instruments composed by Dinescu in her earlier career in 1981. This piece has a very busy bass part and it frequently explores two voices, with pizz and arco playing at the same time in different regions of the bass. Although there is no time marking or measures, it has a sense of forwardness in the intensity and powerfulness of its gestures. The notation sometimes abandons the pentagram system, having only one or two lines, and the notes are loosely grouped together.

Playing Techniques: gliss; s.p.; sfz; tr.; harmonics; art. harmonics; pizz; trem.; app; snap pizz; chords; vibrato; echoton

Duration: 6'30"

Publisher: Editions Choudens/Music Sales Group A.C. 19812

Number of Performers: 2

Annotations: This piece is divided in two parts, the Improvisation and Final. The first part starts with piano solo, followed by a small candeza for the bass (Lent). This part happens in the middle and upper registers of the instrument and has a strong chromatic material, forwardly oriented in sixteens. The Final is a “Presto" in duple meter that has as its main characteristics the quick changes from arco to pizzicato and the use of short notes. It ends with a driven passage of triplets starting on lower and reaching higher notes. Very accented and decisive Piu Vivo ending.

# Gubaidulina, Sofia

## Pantomime

Date of Composition: 1966 Date of Publication: 1991 Instrumentation: db; pf Duration: 12'

Publisher: H. Sikorski

Number of Performers: 2

Annotations: Pantomime is characterized by strongly accented rhythms and the presence of a dark low register ostinato on the piano that haunts the listener through the piece. The double bass explores tritones and a diverse set of techniques such as glissando, col legno and ricochet, allowing the performer to create timbre variations in a deep dark environment. Always moving forward. Extremely well-written piece.

Three Intermezzos - pour contrebasse ou violoncello et piano

Date of Publication: 2017

Instrumentation: db; orch./pf

Duration: 12'

Publisher: Canadian Music Centre Montreal

Number of Performers: 2+

Annotations: Intermezzo 1 starts with a catchy theme in moderate tempo, an interlude that says that some interesting story is about to happen. This theme is developed and reaches to an explosion later on. The second Intermezzo is more dissonant and intense. It includes a very idiomatic climax coming from a busy and chromatic double bass part, finally reaching a slower tempo and fuller sound. The bass is then well accompanied and enriched by the orchestra/piano part. Intermezzo 3 starts piano and mysterious, the double bass part resembles a lament. Cantabile and shifty. Premiere: Gary Karr, 1989. Printed from manuscript.

Annotations: This piece has a recurrent use of double stops glissando. Maconchy explores contrasts by juxtaposing an agitated Allegro that emphasizes aleatory beats, and a Lento with a calm use of harmonics. There is a moment “senza misura” that almost sounds like a Candeza for the double bass. Interesting and eventful piece.

Baião de Doze - Suíte Tocando o Brasil

Date of Composition: 2013

Instrumentation: db ens.

149

## Number of Performers: 4+

Annotations: "The Suite "Tocando o Brasil" brings the idea of four of the most popular national rhytms from Brazil (baião, bossa nova, samba e frevo). The piece was written for the Orchestra Sergipiana de Contrabaixo, inspired by the OSCON and founded by Jair Maciel. In a pedagogical way, the piece also consists in a rhythm exercise to the group. In Baião de Doze there a simple theme, mostly in the first double bass, which sometimes dialogues with the second double bass. The main idea is to bring the atmosphere of the Brazilian Northeastern music, exploring dance, divertimento and simplicity, features so dear to me." - Translated from the composer's notes in the score. Source: SC; C

# Bossa Nova

Date of Composition: 2013 Instrumentation: d ens.

Number of Performers: 4+

Annotations: “In Bossa Nova, the melody is shy/simple but not uninteresting. It starts being delineated by the first double bass, which constantly converses with the second bass. Basses 3 and 4 mantain the rhythm and sustain the harmony. Bossa Nova is, before anything, a song in which the lyrics should arise in the mind of the ones that are listening to it." - Translated from the composer's notes in the score. Source: SC; C

# Chuva no Sertão

Date of Composition: 2013 Instrumentation: db; pf Number of Performers: 2

Annotations: "In a figurative character, Chuva no Sertão illustrates the idea of the “sertanejo" waiting for the rain, which will irrigate the plantations, feed the cattle and end up their thirst, bringing happinees when the process of waiting finally ends. In this sense, the music beggins melancholic, hopeless. A theme in Brazilian Northeastern mode soon arrises, anouncing the new: the first drops of water (articulated between double bass anb piano). After that, everything is a party, or “baião”, a national symbol of the hapinness of the "sertanejo"." - Translated from the composer's notes in the score.

# Lembranças

In this composition, I seek to play with the ondulation of the water (represented by the harp glissandos), the strenth of the water and also its fluidity. The music is modal, in Brazilian Northeastern scale." - Translation from composer's notes.

This score contains graphic notation and no specific measures. All the instructions are in French. It is a rich piece that explores extended techniques, interpretation, and improvisation.

Annotations: Relevant piece for the bass repertoire that displays live electronics and timbre explorations on the double bass by strong usage of extended techniques and harmonics. The piece has two types of notation, when marked lento, it is free from pulsation and during more rhythmic passages, there is a precise notation and tempo recommendation. The sound engineer should read the score and adjust the relative levels of the double bass and electronics on the mixing desk.

Annotations: “The Lost Oxen”. Graduation Exam. “The Lost Oxen proposes to explore the double bass almost as a topography. The performers are invited to approach their instrument with a sense of otherness and wander. The materiality of the instrument - the overwhelming dimension of its size - along with the gestures of the performers as they address extended techniques while pursuing specific sound results, becomes an interaction - ¿surprisingly? - delicate with the instrument. The three instruments work in cooperation to assembly a series of soundscapes that evolve from one state to another, always moving forward, weaving in time." - Notes from the composer Technique Level: Advanced
