  "Long Description": "Underlying the entire score is an intense awareness of the joy and the pain that are ever present in the life and ultimate transfiguration of an artistic genius. Lee's music unfolds into structures built upon short fragments that repeat and expand into larger shapes in a fan-like manner. The harmonies are bold and fresh, filled with unexpected yet completely convincing dramatic destinations.",
