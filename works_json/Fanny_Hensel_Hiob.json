  "Notes": "This portrayal of Job's suffering as a test of his belief in God is dramatically and expressively composed. Its symmetrical form (Chorus, A-Recit., Trio, A-Recit., Chorus) can be seen as symbolic and the question 'Was ist der Mensch?' (What is human being?), which is expressed in several melodic-harmonic variations in the opening chorus, seems to symbolically represent the search for the answer. The recitative and arioso call for four solo voices but a choral performance of these sections is also possible.",
