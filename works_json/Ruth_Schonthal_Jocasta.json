  "Long Description": "The work uses opera, dance and the spoken work to tell the Oedipus story from the imagined perspective of Jocasta, his mother and, later, his wife. She is portrayed as a woman who is deeply scared as a child when her father departed and died. Fearing that Oedipus, her husband, will also abandon her, she clings to him. When he learns what their relationship really is, Jocasta admits to knowing it all along and charges that on some level, so did he. The all-female creative team includes the composer Ruth Schonthal, the director Marya Mazor and the translators of the French libretto by Hélène Cixous.",
