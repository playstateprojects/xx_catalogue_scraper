  "Long Description": "Trawler is a chamber opera inspired by the book by Redmond O'Hanlon, featuring six male soloists and two wordless sopranos accompanied by a small chamber ensemble of 11 instrumentalists. The opera explores universal themes such as man against nature and loyalty in conflict with jealousy, set against the backdrop of environmental and human exploitation. The musical language combines traditional singing techniques with new developments in vocal use, allowing for a wide range of staging options from semi-staged performances to fully-staged productions with visual media.",
