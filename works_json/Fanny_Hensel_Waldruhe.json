  "Notes": "The trio with piano accompaniment describes in a poetic way (eternal) sleep and dream as an entering into guarded nature. All of Fanny Hensel's vocal trios are written for two female voices and tenor. The performance by S1, A1 and A2, as well as S1, S2 and A, is however just as well possible without problems.",
