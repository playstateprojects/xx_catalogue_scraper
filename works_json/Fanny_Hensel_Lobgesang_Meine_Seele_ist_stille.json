  "Notes": "This cantata, the text of which is related to birth, was composed a year after the birth of Fanny Hensel's son Sebastian. The form (Pastorale, Chorus, Rez., Arie, Chorus) is based on the structure of Bach's cantatas, the main difference being the lenghty choral fugue with which the work closes. The \"heart\" of the composition can be seen in the soprano aria \"O dass ich tausend Zungen hätte\". In this aria the translation of the example set by Bach into Romantic compositional style is especially clear.",

  "Long Description": "The cantata, whose content relates to human birth, was composed a year after the birth of her son Sebastian. The formal sequence (Pastorale, Chorus, Recitative, Aria, Chorus) is based on the structure of a Bach cantata with the difference that at the end a large choral fugue forms the most extensive movement of the work. The soprano aria \"O dass ich tausend Zungen hätte\" can be regarded as the 'heart' of the piece. Here the translation of the Bach model into the Romantic sound language becomes particularly clear.",
