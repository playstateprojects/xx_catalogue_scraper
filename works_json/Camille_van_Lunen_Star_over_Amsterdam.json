  "Long Description": "Camille van Lunen's Christmas oratorio 'Star over Amsterdam' is a contemporary retelling of the Nativity story, set in a crowded Amsterdam in December. The composition uses different musical motifs to represent the worlds of the characters: the pregnant foreigner Miriam, the naive hotel boy Tom, and the brave critical journalists. These worlds unite in a final hymn sung together with the audience, symbolizing solidarity. The work is based on Jan Michael's book 'Tom's Tale' and was premiered by the Haarlem Voices, Begijnhof Chamber Group, conducted by Sarah Barrett.",
