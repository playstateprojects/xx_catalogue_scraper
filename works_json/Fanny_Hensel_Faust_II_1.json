  "Long Description": "Arrangement of Fanny Hensels beautiful „Faust\" for orchestra instead of the original piano. \"... this score is one of the many acts of mine that will forever remain undone\". Fanny Hensel wrote this to the singer Franz Hauser in a letter 1843. Her comment refers to the orchestration of her Faust scene, composed only with piano accompaniment. That the piece cries out for orchestration, is clear to those who look at the original score from a later perspective. The demand for instrumental colours in its atmosphere is too great, everything points too clearly to a large-scale ensemble, the prospect of being able to further develop the motifs and thematic structures and references is too promising.",
