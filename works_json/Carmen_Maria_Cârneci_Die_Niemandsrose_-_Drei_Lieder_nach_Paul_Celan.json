  "Notes": "The three Celan-Lieder have been primarily written for (bass-)baritone. However, they may also be addressed to a low female voice since the poetic texts themselves do not indicate a male-specific lyrical subject. In selecting these three poems the woman composer followed main ideas from Celan's poetry, such as positive and negative alienation, and the relationship between man and God.",

  "Long Description": "The three Celan-Lieder were primarily written for (bass-)baritone but can also be performed by a low female voice, as the poetic texts do not specify a male lyrical subject. The composer drew inspiration from Paul Celan's poetry, focusing on themes like alienation and the relationship between humanity and the divine, including the nuanced morbidity found in his love poems.",
