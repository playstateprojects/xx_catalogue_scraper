  "Notes": "This song collection is representative for the songs written by Josephine Lang. The edition uses the authors of the texts as selection criteria. It contains all the Heine and Lenau settings; and Goethe's omnipresence in the European art song was an added good reason to enlist him, too, in the attempt to direct attention anew to the almost forgotten composer.",
