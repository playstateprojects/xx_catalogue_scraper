  "Long Description": "This aria is part of the cantata 'Lobgesang', which relates to the theme of birth, composed a year after the birth of Fanny Hensel's son Sebastian. The form is based on the structure of Bach's cantatas, with the main difference being the lengthy choral fugue that concludes the work. The aria 'O daß ich tausend Zungen hätte' stands out as the 'heart' of the composition, showcasing the translation of Bach's influence into the Romantic style. Fanny Hensel provided a piano accompaniment only for this aria, not for the entire cantata. The edition includes the piano part as written by Hensel and also contains the preceding recitative 'Ein Weib, wenn sie gebieret', typically performed by the soprano soloist.",
  "Short Description": "Aria for soprano and piano from the cantata 'Lobgesang', with text by Johann Mentzer and piano accompaniment by Fanny Hensel.",
