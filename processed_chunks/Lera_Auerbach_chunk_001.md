## LERA AUERBACH

Lera Auerbach, the Russian-American composer, poet, writer, visual artist and concert pianist who performs regularly in major halls throughout the world, has published more than 100 works for orchestra, opera and ballet, as well as choral and chamber music. Au- erbach was born in the Russian city of Chelyabinsk on the border of Siberia. As pianist and composer, she graduated with bachelor's and master's degrees from the Juilliard School in New York and received her post-graduate degree as a concert pianist from the Hanover University of Music, Drama and Media in Germany.

Her compositions are performed worldwide by leading musicians, including violinists Gi- don Kremer, Leonidas Kavakos, Vadim Gluzman, Philippe Quint, Hilary Hahn, Vadim Repin, Daniel Hope, Julian Rachlin, Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg and Dmitry Sitkovetsky; violists Kim Kashkashian and David Aaron Carpenter; cellists Alisa Weilerstein, Gautier Capuçon and David Geringas; and singers Zoryana Kushpler, Natalia Ushakova, Martin Winkler, Nikita Storojev and Stella Grigorian, among many others. Auerbach has written eight string quartets that have been championed by the Tokyo, Borromeo, Parker, Jasper, Ying, Peterson, Artemis, Granados and RTÉ Vanbrugh string quartets.

Auerbach's works for orchestra are performed by the world's leading conductors, inclu- ding Christoph Eschenbach, Vladimir Fedoseyev, Vladimir Spivakov, Neeme Järvi, Vladi- mir and Dmitri Jurowski, Charles Dutoit, Andris Nelsons, András Keller, Hiroyuki Iwaki, Osmo Vänskä and Tõnu Kaljuste.

Choreographers and stage directors such as John Neumeier, Aszure Barton, Goyo Monte- ro, Terence Kohler, Sol León, Paul Lightfoot, Medhi Walerski, Reginaldo Oliveira, Christi- ne Milietz, and John La Bouchardière have staged Auerbach's ballets and operas, which have been produced in major theaters on every continent, including the Hamburg State Opera, Vienna's Theater an der Wien, New York's Lincoln Center, the National Ballet of Canada, the National Ballet of China, the Royal Danish Theater, the Nuremberg State The- ater, the Finnish National Theater, Moscow's Stanislavsky Theater, the Netherlands Dance Theatre, the San Francisco Ballet and numerous others.

Auerbach has been composer-in-residence with various orchestras and music festivals, including the Staatskapelle Dresden (Germany), São Paulo Symphony (Brazil), Orchestra Ensemble Kanazawa (Japan), Concerto Budapest Symphony Orchestra (Hungary), New Century Chamber Orchestra (USA), Verbier Festival (Switzerland), Trondheim Festival (Norway), Marlboro Festival (USA), Musikfest Bremen (Germany), Lockenhaus Festival (Austria) and Pacific Music Festival (Japan). In 2015, Auerbach is composer-in-residence at the Trans-Siberian Art Festival and the Rheingau Musik Festival in Germany. CD and DVD releases of Auerbach's works are available on the Deutsche Grammophon, ECM, ARTE, PBS, BIS, Capriccio and Cedille labels.

Auerbach is equally prolific in literature and has published three books of poetry in Rus- sian. Gérard Depardieu, Sergei Yursky and Evgeny Kissin have been reciting her poems in performances; Sergei Yursky also recorded a poetry CD from her book, Stairs to Eternity, and has written the foreword for her Hanover Notebooks. Auerbach's poetry and prose is included in various anthologies, as well as in the textbook of required reading for Russi- an high school literature classes. In 1996, the International Pushkin Society in New York named her Poet of the Year. In 1997, Doctor of philological sciences Vyacheslav Okeansky published a treatise on her poetry: ‘Concealment as the essence of the poetic word (Lunar Mysteria in the Poetry of Lera Auerbach)'. She is the author of several librettos and is a regular contributor to the Best American Poetry blog. In her first English-language book, Excess of Being, published by Arch Street Press in 2015, she revitalizes the form of aphoris- ms. Her writing is provocative, dark, ironic and humorous, perceptively dealing with life's kaleidoscopic questions.

Auerbach often gives poetry readings (in Russian and English), presentations and talks, as well as master classes in various venues, including Harvard University, University of Mi- chigan, Cleveland Institute, Open Society Institute in New York, Tokyo University, World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Music Center of Budapest, Hungary and the poe- try festival of West Cork, Ireland, as well as festivals in Verbier, Aspen, Marlboro, Sapporo and others.

Auerbach has been drawing and sketching all her life as part of her creative process. In 2009, after a devastating fire destroyed her studio in New York, she started prolifically pain- ting and sculpting. Her art has been included in several exhibitions and, in 2013, she had her first solo exhibition in Norway. Her paintings are included in private collections, sold in auctions, reproduced in magazines, and used on the covers of CDs and books.

Auerbach's opera, Gogol, for which she wrote both the libretto and music, received its highly acclaimed world premiere in Vienna in 2011. Two of her oil paintings, related to this opera, were sold in the Gogol exhibition held in Moscow that year. Her groundbreaking a cappella opera, The Blind, has received productions in Germany, Norway, Russia, the United States and Austria.

Auerbach's ballet, The Little Mermaid, was the winner of a 2012 ECHO Klassik award for Best Music DVD. It also received two Golden Mask awards and has been per- formed over 250 times worldwide. Auerbach's first collaboration with choreographer John Neumeier, the ballet Préludes CV, was recently revived to commemorate the 40^{th} an- niversary of the Hamburg Ballet. In 2014, on a commission by the Hamburg State Theater and the Moscow Stanislavsky Theater, Auerbach composed a two-act ballet, Tatiana, after Pushkin's Evgeny Onegin.

Auerbach has also collaborated with the Netherlands Dance Theatre and its choreogra- phers Sol León and Paul Lightfoot on Shine a Light; with Goyo Montero on Don Juan and Faust for the Staatstheater Nürnberg; with Aszure Barton on Watch Her for the National Ballet of Canada; with Tim Plegge on Momo and Reginaldo Oliveira on Mythos for the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe; and with Terence Kohler on four ballets: Heroes for the Munich State Ballet, Take Your Time for the Chinese Na- tional Ballet, 11:11 for the Flanders National Ballet and Cinderella for the Finnish National Ballet.

Other recent highlights include Auerbach's oratorio, In Praise of Peace, commissi- oned for the 20th anniversary of the Verbier Festival, the multilingual Requiem Ode to Peace for the Staatskapelle Dresden, the string symphony Memoria de la luz, her vast Russian Requiem, two violin concertos, a double concerto for violin, pi- ano and orchestra, Symphonies Nos. 1, Chimera, and 2, Requiem for a Poet, Gallows Songs for saxophone quartet and chorus, and several symphonic poems: Post silentium, Eterniday and Dreams and Whispers of Poseidon.

Auerbach has received numerous awards, including the prestigious Hindemith Prize, the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship, the Deutschlandfunk Young Artists Prize and the ECHO Klassik award, among others. The World Economic Forum selected Auerbach in 2007 as a Young Global Leader and in 2014 as a Cultural Leader, inviting her to give presentations and discussions on the fascinating topic of borderless creativity.
