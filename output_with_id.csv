In 1935, because of her Jewish heritage, she was banished from the conservatory. The persecution of Jews by the Nazi regime forced the family into exile and to settle in Stockholm. In 1941 due the dangerous political situation the family had to flee a second time, this time settling in Mexico City. Ruth Schonthal never followed the prevalent contemporary aesthetic fashions. At a time when Anton Webern and John Cage were the American role models, she followed her own musical path, never denying her own classic-romantic heritage. The extraordinarily varied impressions she absorbed in the course of her life in different parts of the world provided the foundation of her musical style.",Ruth Schonthal's compositions reflect questions and themes of today's world.,"European tradition,Mexican folk music,Aleatoric,Minimal Music",,,

After long, lyrical high arcs on the viola, the orchestra jumps in with exotic percussive effects. Every now and then, a snatch of something tonal and vaguely familiar drifts in. The first movement builds to a glistening cha-cha. The shimmering, unearthly second movement is interrupted by huge, dissonant brass chords. The third movement features chimes, sirens, apocalyptic drums, and the feeling of the world collapsing set against snatches of rhythmic patterns and odd whiffs of tonality. The gorgeous fourth movement is dominated by a big, lyrical viola solo with a grab-holdable melody. The final section virtually follows traditional concerto form, with dialogue between soloist and orchestra, and builds to an audacious, richly-textured finale suggestive of Mahler at his most kitschy.

Auch das zweite Stück bringt überraschende melodische und harmonische Wendungen. „Beide Bagatellen schrieb die Komponistin für die Schüler des 1835 gegründeten Schindelmeiserschen Musik-Instituts, und folglich verzichtete sie für einmal auf virtuose Brillanz. Die kurzen, sehr transparent gesetzten Stücke eignen sich daher gut für den Unterricht, auch wenn sie bei sauberer Stimmführung nicht ganz ohne Tücken sind (im Schwierigkeitsgrad etwa mit den leichteren der Lieder ohne Worte von Bruder Felix vergleichbar).” (Animato)",Two easy pieces well suited for piano lessons.,"educational,piano",fue 1230,979-0-50012-023-0,

This remarkable event, which doubled the size of the young United States of America, is the background of the story of the Pontalba family. Because of it, the family had to leave New Orleans for France. The story of Micaela who married into this family is a dramatic one. After many years of financial struggle, Micaela's father-in-law in a desperate attempt to keep control of her dowry tries to kill her. He fails and, in his shame, kills himself. Micaela thus secures her inheritance and returns to New Orleans. As the first woman architect, she builds the famous Pontalba buildings in Jackson Square. She has managed to transcend the personal tragedies of her life, remain true to her calling, and to leave a lasting legacy of beauty and tranquillity for the city of her birth.","An opera commissioned by New Orleans Opera, telling the story of the Pontalba family and Micaela's dramatic life.","Louisiana Purchase,New Orleans,female architect",,,

Wilson's Tales of the Scottish Border.",Opera,20th Century,"1 bassoon,1 clarinet,1 flute,1 horn,1 oboe,2 percussion,bassoon,clarinet,horn,oboe,percussion,piano (celesta),strings (1 violin, 0 viola, 1 cello, 0 double bass),timpani",Puccini's Gianni Schicchi,"This, Musgrave's first opera, was composed very shortly after her return from Paris in 1955, where she had been studying with Nadia Boulanger for the previous four years. The story is taken from J. M. Wilson's Tales of the Scottish Border. A parallel with Puccini's Gianni Schicchi will be obvious to any opera lover. However, this is not surprising since both share a common source: Dante's Inferno, though in this opera the date is mid-sixteenth century and set in pre-Reformation Scotland. With the cooperation of a witch-woman, Geills, the Abbot of Drimock feathers his nest by persuading the dying rich of the neighbourhood to alter their wills in his favour. In a particularly complex case, however, he declines to reward Geills. Bess, whose husband, the local laird Sir William, is grievously ill, has borne a child, Maggie, by the Abbot. Sir William dies, leaving his fortune to Maggie (whose plans to marry do not have her mother's approval) and to the Edinburgh lepers. Determined not to be outdone, Bess and the Abbot hush up the death and prepare to stage a reenactment which will prevent the marriage and save the fortune. The plans go awry and with Geills's help Maggie manages to turn everything to her advantage.",A famous opera by Thea Musgrave,"Dante's Inferno,Nadia Boulanger,Scottish Border",,,

In response to Ravel's texts (by Évariste de Parny, who claimed that his ‘Madagascar Songs' were translations from folk sources, although he had never been there), I searched for poetry by contemporary African women, and found it in Irène Assiba d'Almeida's French-language anthology A Rain of Words. The three writers represented here, Fatou Ndiaye Sow, Véronique Tadjo and Marie-Léontine Tsibinda come from Senegal, Ivory Coast and Congo-Brazzaville respectively. All were born in the 1950s. The poems evoke local life: a lullaby, the sound of drums, the appearance of a crocodile. The final poem, describing the continuity of village life, closes with a simple invocation which may recall the ending of Ravel's composition. Nuits d'Afrique is warmly dedicated to Ailish Tynan. My thanks also to Michel Vallat for his advice about French prosody.","A vocal piece for soprano, flute, cello, and piano, commissioned by Wigmore Hall, with text in French by Evariste Parnay.","Contemporary,French text,African poetry",CH84689,,Chester Music Ltd

They represent a genre of different form types: 1. the unaccompanied folk duet (to be sung outdoors), 2. the lyrical, piano-accompanied duet (to be situated in the intimate setting of domestic music-making), 3. the dramatic scene for concert and (imaginary) stage. The duet as an occasion for the juxtaposition of two characters and the musical realization of a dramatic conflict has obviously inspired the composer particularly. Here she has succeeded in compositions that are unique in the duet literature of the 19th century. It is remarkable that the composer understands the concept of the duet in a much more complex way than others in her time. The desire to illuminate as many aspects of two-part singing as possible and to design musical scenes with a special sense for dramatic processes also distinguishes her from her brother Felix.",Vocal,Romantic,"2 female voices and piano,soprano and tenor plus piano",12 Songs collection by Felix Mendelssohn,"The duets composed by Fanny Hensel feature great variety in terms of form and color, and the very earliest one of them was even included by brother Felix in his 12 Songs collection. Some of them are plain pieces intended for domestic music-making (a cappella duets), some are wonderful concertante works. While the duets for 2 female voices and piano are quite popular in part and have already been recorded on CD, almost none of the pieces for soprano and tenor plus piano has become generally known so far. Still, they include some particularly ambitious duets which go clearly beyond private performance settings.","Duets complete edition Vol. 1-5 by Fanny Hensel, featuring a variety of form types from folk to dramatic scenes.","duet,piano accompaniment,19th century,Fanny Hensel",fue 6441,979-0-50012-012-4,Furore

The piece combines a few of the Cid's exploits (related by a speaking 'Evangelist') with a choral mass setting, showcasing the absurd and dangerous contradiction between religious fervour and blood lust.","A choral work combining texts from the Latin Mass and the Spanish epic 'Poema de Mio Cid', commissioned by the BBC and first performed in 1988.","BBC commission,contemporary choral music,unaccompanied chorus",CH58776,,Chester Music Ltd

As the noose tightens round his neck he fantasises about his escape down-river and back to his wife and home. The story puts side by side the ‘real' world of action (speech and sound effects), with the 'imaginary' world (singing) of Farquhar as he thinks, feels and remembers. The music in the orchestra is continuous; the work is truly conceived as an opera and not a play with incidental music.","An opera based on a short story by Ambrose Bierce about the American Civil War, focusing on a planter's fantasy of escape before execution.","American Civil War,radio opera,psychological drama",,,

During my year of writing, starting in the spring, I had to break off twice, in early autumn and at the start of the new year; so I titled the three parts of this composition with the name of the month in which I started or restarted it – April, October and February. My first impression, inviting me to begin the piece, was simply the sound in April of new leaves on branches moving in the wind; I realised I was hearing the repeated “afresh” sound at the end of Philip Larkin's poem, The Trees; 'Last year is dead, they seem to say, Begin afresh, afresh, afresh.' 1. April often refers to this refreshing aural moment. Big textures suddenly cut away to reveal very quiet, almost inaudible movement. II. October observes the heaviness of trees still in leaf amidst increasing darkness. III. February begins by considering the depth and strength of tree roots, despite the opposition of cold and darkness. These impressions may seem generic – they're tree events I look forward to every year.

Scrooge, the miser, berates his clerk, Bob Cratchit, for arriving at work late and loudly derides the whole idea of Christmas. Later that night the ghost of Scrooge's deceased partner, Jacob Marley, confronts him. Marley laments that he is forever doomed because of his narrow and selfish life. He warns of a worse fate awaiting Scrooge. At the strike of one, The Spirit of Christmas Past appears. He shows Scrooge memories of his own childhood: his fondness for his sister Fan and the breakdown of his relationship for his young love, Belle. In Act Two, the jovial spirit of The Spirit of Christmas Present wakes Scrooge and leads him to the Cratchit house. There, the family, including Tiny Tim, assembles for Christmas dinner. Despite their poverty there is an atmosphere of warmth and merriment. Soon after, The Spirit of Christmas Future appears out of the gloom with several starving children (including Tiny Tim) and, in their desperation, they cling to him. He violently pushes them down. Tiny Tim is crushed and falls dead. Bewildered and distressed by events, Scrooge finds himself in a deserted graveyard facing his own tombstone, inscribed ‘Ebenezer Scrooge, miser; who lived unloved and alone.' Terrified, he renounces his miserly ways and swears henceforth to honour the spirit of Christmas.","An opera based on Charles Dickens' story, featuring Scrooge's transformation after encounters with Christmas spirits.","Charles Dickens,Christmas,Opera,World Premiere,contemporary,dramatic,opera",,,

The orchestral winds enter unobtrusively, one by one until gradually approaching the first of two major tuttis. After the second of these (which contrasts strong orchestral sentences with almost brutal oboe attacks) the music winds down, again lyrically, and with the oboe nearly always in the foreground. The second movement could be compared with a passacaglia structure; an orchestral grid that repeats multiple times, but always in transformed scoring, for strings and (later on) bassoons only, with ornamentation by the oboe soloist. Finally the winds re-enter with a short sequence of scherzo-like noises, before an extended, up-tempo coda brings the music to its conclusion with, once more, the oboe fluently in the foreground.","Oboe Concerto by Judith Weir performed by Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, Douglas Boyd, conductor; Celia Craig, oboe","autobiographical,lyrical,memory exercise",Artaria AUECL2300001,,Chester Music Ltd

The work dramatizes the difference between the oboe and percussion before bringing them harmoniously together.,Orchestral,Contemporary,"1 cor anglais,1 tuba,2 bassoons,2 clarinets,2 flutes,2 trombones,2 trumpets,3 horns,harp,oboe,percussion,strings",,"This work was commissioned by the BBC for Evelyn Glennie and Nicholas Daniel. It was an exciting challenge to write a dramatic work for such dissimilar instruments. I decided that I would strongly dramatize this difference before bringing them harmoniously together. Thus, at the beginning of the work, the two soloists are standing as far apart as possible: the solo percussion to the conductor's right, behind the cellos, and the oboe on the opposite side behind the first violins. For each of the four ensuing sections the soloists move around the orchestra to different positions, changes that are always dramatically motivated. Throughout, the two soloists are aware of each other and play to get each other's attention, only coming together musically and physically in the very last section. The slow first section is marked Desolate, lonely. When the oboe first enters, it responds initially to the cor anglais, and then later to a solo clarinet. This encourages the oboeist to go on stage and take a position near his fellow woodwinds, precipitating the second movement. The solo percussion, hoping to attract the oboe's attention moves to the vibraphone, which is set closer at hand. The second section is a jaunty scherzo, mostly in 5/4 time, and for a while, it seems that the oboe responds favourably to the percussion, but then the horns attract its attention and the oboeist eventually moves so as to be close to them and the harp. In frustration the solo percussion moves to the drums (congas, tomtoms and bongos). The third section Dramatic: furioso/espressivo is a series of confrontations. Aggressive music for the percussion (supported by strings and brass) alternates with an expressive solo oboe (accompanied by horns and harp). These alternations come ever closer together ending in a big climax. The oboe finally turns to the percussion and 'invites' the player to listen. The percussion responds and so sets the scene for both soloists to come down stage centre, bonding for the final section: Warm, leading to Passionate and finally, Exultant, a whirling coda.","A dramatic work for oboe and percussion commissioned by the BBC, highlighting the instruments' differences before uniting them.","dramatic,interactive performance,movement,soloists,theatrical",,,Novello & Co Ltd
