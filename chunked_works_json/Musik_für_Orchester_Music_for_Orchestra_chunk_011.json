      "Long Description": "This oratorio is the third of three church works composed in 1831; its scoring is more abundant than that of the cantatas composed prior to it. Once again Fanny looks back in musical history, this time to the pre-Baroque era, and adds a new dimension to her own compositional language by doing so. At times modal harmonies create an \"archaic\" atmosphere for the biblical texts.",
